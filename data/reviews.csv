ANYHOW, most will agree that NOTHING  beats the smell of fresh coffee in the morning. Or tea. Steeped tea in particular, is tried and true morning picker upper. 

i will confess that I am a Timmies fanatic and hold it dear to my heart, and it pains me to write such a review about one that was so dear; but I am so VEXED and I need to vent. I am giving this location a 2 star cuz i have nostalgia but really it's a ONE.

This particular location has been dear to be for as long as I can remember- it's been my go-to place on any day or night for a lil bit of java fix, whether it be during cramp time for exams or just to catch up with a buddy over a warm cup(s) of whatever; it was open 24 hrs for the longest time which made it the perfect spot.

Then it wasn't 24hrs anymore except on Fridays and Saturdays which bites but still good. I have always enjoyed the quick service here even when the line went out the doors and had no problems returning to THIS location even though there are many within walking distance, until recently.

So Currently I am working two jobs; one in day and one in night because I am insane. This makes good cup(s) of java essential to my being awake; I can't imagine how much more I spend at Timmies these days.Anywho.

Since I have started my night gig(4 months ago), I can't seem to get no satisfaction from this place. The coffee is ALWAYS burnt - I thought maybe it was because I came near closing time that it may be the case. But no, any time after 5pm I have been here, the coffee is BURNT. So I switched to steeped tea; and the friggin TEA is burnt! How do you burn tea? Well it is brewed the way and stored same way coffees are so if it sits for a long time on the burner it burns. Why am I paying for burnt anything? Because the service was good. But the service of the night crew completely shat itself recently- I have never met such rude set of people who not only ignore your existence in the store ,rudely repeat after you, talk in another tongue in front of you(which I find rude) and openly roll their eyes at you. However, beggers can't be choosers and I continued to drink burnt crap because all other Timmies in the area closes before 11pm - until recently. 

Recently I discovered that this particular set of people -do not practice what we know to be a Timmies practice? you know, writing the time when the pot was brewed and dumping it after a certain time- they ran a national campaign for that not too long ago- yeah, they don't do that here during the night shift.
If they are ignoring one of the most fundamental things that makes Timmies what it is , I dare ask what else they're not doing so I am taking my tiny broken wallet else where.

That is all. I am done ranting.",1,StCSYeJ1I-G1LbdpW65kGQ

Baristas always seem to be friendly and chatty, and I've never encountered someone who was grumpy, pissy, or a chore to deal with. I can't say this is typical of the establishment; I may just have amazing luck whenever I go.

This old bank, situated just south of Bloor St, where Dundas and Roncesvalles split, has a good amount of seating. There are two tables to the right (upon entering), near the table with all the coffee accessories on it (milk, cream, etc.)

To the left, there are four comfy chairs with a dividing wall, the other side of which has more tables and chairs.

They have a very nice patio, with plenty of room for you to enjoy a coffee while reading, working, or even playing games on your laptop.

The only issue with this Starbucks, and it's not the fault of the business itself, is that because of it's close proximity to the Dundas West subway station (a less than two minute walk), is it's often very busy. The line always moves quick, but if you're looking for a place to sit, you may have issues. It isn't as bad during the warmer months, as people will be sitting on the patio, or just standing around outside.

Having lived in vancouver for three years, all you see at the corner of your eye is the next starbucks..... so i really try to stay away from them and look for the independent coffee roasters that do not mass produce their baked goods and made in house. I don't have anything against them, i think their coffee is good and service is usually on par. I even worked at one for a few months during a rough time in my short career.

But when there are still many starbucks lovers, you cannot always be picky and opt to tag along for the ride...and I'm glad I did today! I noticed people holding red cups and I thought it looked like Starbucks - and red cups mean christmas season meaning PEPPERMINT MOCHAS!

Looking up on the board and seeing that a skinny was only 100 calories, I really could not resist. Although I didn't want it as sweet as their normal dosage, they must've missed it on their call-out because a normal skinny was made. to my surprise.. it actually wasn't too too sweet and tasted creamy and DELICIOUS?

So I just wanted to rant about a couple of things.

I showed up a little after 1:00 on a weekday and the place was surprisingly empty. I decided to order what's become a recurring item for me: Chili. It's actually not great, but I find it oddly comforting somehow.

Anyway, after a wait of about a minute, my meal was ready for pickup. And, because hope springs eternal, I decided to ask for hot sauce from the server. (I do this every single time, praying that Tim Horton's has finally decided to offer little packets of hot sauce.) And not only did they not have hot sauce, the server didn't even know what hot sauce was. (""Hot...sauce?"" she said, with complete confusion on her face.)

I took the chili back to one of the comfy booths and here's where my second rant comes into play. For some bizarre reason, Tim Horton's insists on providing an unreasonably wide spoon with their soups and chili. This makes it very difficult to comfortably eat your meal and, worse, you wind up with little sores on the side of your mouth afterwards (from the spoon slicing into you with every bite). I really need to start asking for a plastic spoon, as those are normal sized.

The chili was fine, though a bit more gelatinous than usual, and the accompanying bread was extremely fresh and quite delicious. (The provided packet of butter was useless, as it apparently came straight out of the fridge and was consequently rock hard.)

I also got a glazed original donut and it was really, really good.",0,iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ

Their more elaborate espresso based drinks are passable because they are hidden in their various syrups and sauces. Their teas are okay, but pretty basic in comparison to the dedicated tea houses which have become popular. Their food is prepackaged and unappetizing. Their baked goods are okay, but far from fresh. It's always interesting to read about what happened to Starbucks in Australia...

BUT, I gave this location 3 stars because it is by far, in my opinion, the best atmosphere for parking to do work or have an intimate conversation of all the Starbucks in the Beach, usually because it is a little less busy than some of the others.

1. They've nailed the ordering system - during peak times, you get a number on a piece of paper when you've paid and they call your order number when it's ready to go.

2. The decor is classier than most Tim Horton's you'll visit. There are booths that are kept very clean and there's a certain amount of privacy and roominess. I wouldn't hesitate to meet a friend here for coffee or a chat, and you can't really say that about most Tim Horton's - you usually don't want to stick around for very long.

3. It's open 24 hours. Very handy when you're stumbling home drunk after a night at one of the nearb (douche) bars and want a bagel or a donut to soak up all the beer in your tummy.

4. The washrooms. If you're in this neighbourhood and you need to ""go"", head to Tim Horton's. You don't need a key to use the washrooms and no one will glare at you when you beeline for the washrooms without buying anything.

I knew they had a store here since it's on their website and people walked around with their cups.  But when I looked at mall map... nothing.  I even walked around the ENTIRE mall in search of it.  I couldn't find it... I ended up going to Second Cup (which is just as good and Canadian).

Turns out the reason why I couldn't find it is because it's INconveniently OUTSIDE the mall but 'attached' to the physical building.  The only way to access it is to walk out the mall and voila, order to your hearts content.  Due to the fact it's outside, it has less traffic than Second Cup so it's easy to get an espresso drink without waiting.  

Service is quick and efficient.  The cappuccino wasn't bad but certainly not the best. Average fare for mall coffee. So if you're desperate for Starbucks, trek outside.  Otherwise, you have choices inside the mall with Second Cup, Michel Baguettes, Tim Hortens, and Faema that are more conveniently located inside.",0,PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA

Warning, this place is hella slow IF you visit while people are training.  There were 2 girls during the time of my visit and I stood in line, only person there, for quite a few minutes while 1 girl was making a drink and the other girl, who I assume was training, was doing something with her back towards me.  She seemed nervous, so I think she was trying to avoid interacting with customers.

Finally, it was the barista who was making a drink who acknowledged me.  It was very strange as in most locations, they say ""Hi"" and want to take your order ASAP!

After I order my drink, I waited some more, until the slightly more experienced one said they were out of Blonde and had to wait for it for them to make more.  Ummm...ok.  Then she said the machine was broken, spoke to some kinda manager, and offered to make me any other drink off the menu in Venti + whatever bakery item I wanted.

When I got my drink, I asked barista which drink it was.  She then told me it was the drink I originally ordered, even though I was told they were out/machine was broken.  Very confusing.  I think barista just didn't know what she was doing.  Customer who ordered after me, also waited longer than usual, but got her drink before I did.

I have absolutely no problem with people training, but at least pair them up with someone who knows what they're doing.

I been too many where they have three lines and everyone is pile in one while the others are empty or you get a line that is slow and other move faster and people who came in after you. Leave before you. This why i like tim hortons that have just the one line. Service is usually quick which is good because this store cant really afford to keep a long line since about 5 or 6 people and you are at the door. That is only issue with the line.

My other grips are seating. If you want sit down. Good luck.... i see groups of older chinese seniors take up 5 or 6 table at one side and its not a large tim hortons. Maybe have 13 of those two person tables at best.

There is no drive through which is actually not a bad thing because the parking lot is a mess its small and not easy to manage over the other cars and people. Most of the time it is basically one car lanes which is a pain.

There is shopper drugmart as well as small convience store and dry cleaner so its reasonable jusy not the best.",0,bJTKxBIvb_AR8d4SuLPV8g

I come anytime between once and three times a day, every day.
So, the coffee is Starbucks coffee.  Most people know how it tastes!  It's infinitely better than Tim Hortons.  The pastries call out to me every single time but I do my best to resist-I try to tell myself they won't taste as nice as they look.
Why the 5 stars?  The staff!  The baristas are amazing.  There is often a long line as half the hospital decides it's caffeine time but they zip through it.  They are ALWAYS cheery and friendly.

They don't follow the proper practices of starbucks and definitely were not trained on drinks quality - are they even barista certified?

The store itself is very cramped and the line is always out the door. POS goes by fast but you'd usually wait 12 minutes for a drink. Whatever, not a big deal.

Drink quality is not consistent with other starbucks. (worked at one and had a very strict manager, especially on drink quality - got tested on foam of each drink, how high you fill it up, the exact order you have to call it out etc) They had 3 staff on bar - 2 on hot, 1 on cold and it was still queued up till no tomorrow. One girl was there calling out drinks and definitely had trouble with that because it wasted time as she was slowly reading the cups. She'd also set up the drinks everywhere to the point where it'd be spread out and messy, which inevitably made it difficult for customers to get their drink when it is so chaotic. 

The way they made the drink .. oh god, it hurt my heart a bit, especially when it costs a customer $4-7 for a drink. Each hot drink was not poured to the rim, which is starbs standard. The way she whipped cream each drink was messy and definitely not starbs standard either; it ended up toppling over (there's a specific way each barista is taught to not have that) and it made each drink super messy as the customer grabbed it. I'm usually not one to pick on the way a barista makes a drink, unless it falls super short of the standard and I'm paying $8 for 2 drinks .. for quality.

She was super nice though and didn't lose patience with all the ratchets complaining

So many other people were getting their sandwiches and baked goods before us and after 15 minutes they gave her the croissant but no apology, ok fine. I'm still waiting for my scone, after another 5 minutes nothing. I asked someone who was walking around as if he had nothing to do, he said oh we don't have any more...... okay so I wasn't just gonna get anything because you didn't have the scone. He said do you want something else, I said at the point whatever. After another 5 minutes he returned with a blueberry scone and was so nonchalant about it.

When I was at this location on a Saturday morning, the service was extremely slow; they only had a cashier and a barista on staff for a line up to the door. I had to use the washroom and it was very dirty and messy (lots of toilet paper on the floor, no soap, garbage was full); and this was at the beginning of the day.

They have signs all around the store promoting their new summer drinks and encouraging customers to go purchase it. So we went to order the mango black tea lemonade and they told us it was sold out! REALLY?! On a hot summer weekend, while this drink is on promotion all around the restaurant, inside and outside, you don't stock up enough inventory to make this drink?! I felt very disappointed! 

So we ordered the sparkling passion tango tea pineapple which they suggested that was really good too but we requested with less ice. As we got our drink, we were disappointed! It was super sweet like drinking sugar water with not much flavour because the sweetness overrides everything. And less ice? We got totally NO ICE at all!! Which was extremely disappointing because on a hot summer day in the afternoon when it's 30 degrees outside, all I want is a cold, refreshing drink to cool me down, not a room temperature sugar water which I pay $5 for!!! And it's suppose to be sparkling, not even close, tastes like pop that you have opened for over 2 hours sitting in the heat. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm talking about!

Think the drink was disappointing enough, guess again, the washroom was WORSE!! Once I walk in, it was a messy disaster!! There's shredded toilet paper all over the floor, zero toilet paper, floor was dirty and messy, felt like I walked into a port-a-potty. DISGUSTING x 100000

As I quickly learned, the bright sun gets directly in your eyes sitting at the window bar. Kudos to Starbucks for installing blinds that are easily pulled down to keep the sun out.

The few tables were all occupied by people doing homework and/or using wifi. I watched a constant flow of disappointed customers that had no where to sit. Maybe there should be a time limit for people occupying tables - especially when there are so few in the store.

I buy drinks from this place because its right across from George Brown College. I may have to walk all the way to King street for my drink now if I don't see any positive outcomes soon. 

I was served by a ""barista"" named Ashley. I was ok when she said Hi and helped me load 5.00 on my Starbucks Card. I felt truly ignored upon when they spoke to a customer behind me and didn't give a damn because I just wanted my drink. So I let the customer and Ashley, plus some other male employee talk as I opened my MacBook and sat down on a corner to use their internet. I was waiting for a while (probably 10 minutes) and didn't care. But I had to remind Ashley that she had forgotten about my drink. 

By the time she made my drink she apologized about the delay but gave me attitude. I disliked her behaviour and I was ok with the apology I just found her a bit snotty and unfriendly. She also asked me ""are you waiting for a drink?"" in this really terrible ""I don't really care"" attitude. Why would you be working at a Starbucks if you didn't care?

Oh and Kyle is friendly. I actually like the store manager there so its a pity. He's nice enough to pay attention to me as a customer. He'll make a conversation even though I am not very talkative to most of the employees when I walk in there. Well its off to Second Cup for my London Fog then whenever and if ever I'm in a rush. I may come back if they decide to change Ashley to another location or lecture her a bit about giving customers attitude.

I used to order a Cinnamon Dolce Latte or Earl Grey Tea Latte ALL THE TIME.

No so I sucked on cold hot coffee or hot iced coffee depending on how you look at it.

My second trip I ordered a sausage biscuit and again I tried for an iced coffee. Success! The biscuit was light and tasty! Mix almost between a biscuit and a muffin. Was delicious. The coffee was cold this time too! When it's done right, their coffee is amazing!

I have also noticed that they are severely understaffed most the time and a lack of focus on doing their jobs where they are otherwise assigned to.

There is no reason why they shouldn't be able to separate my transaction at the drive thru, I understand if it's rush hour, but there was no other cars ordering except for me. Secondly, if I was in a car full of people who wanted to pay for their own drinks, are they also going to refuse me? The standard at most stores, including the one I previously worked at, was that we are able to separate your transactions as long as it's not unreasonable and that there is not long line up.

I asked for 180 degree latte, and only got extra hot. When they make a mistake on a white MOCHA frappacino, mocha which is chocolate type + coffee, I just get the chocolate without the coffee. Then the barista proceeds to put the drink back into the blender with extra liquid of coffee pumps, so now the frappacino is extra watery and not slush.

Once inside, it is a little confusing as there are two separate counter areas and I was not quite sure which counter to go to to order versus where to pick up my order. The staff are very friendly and take the time to get to know you (especially since I was the only one in the store on several consecutive early mornings).

There were about four employees working at the time and they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The store seriously needs to employ more staff.  Anyway, someone ahead of us ordered a milkshake type beverage that contained whipped cream on top. 

This is what I witnessed from an employee:

- went into the fridge and put whipped cream on top of beverage
- scraped it off
- went back to the fridge and put whipped cream on again
- scraped it off again
- went back to the fridge and put whipped cream on again
- scraped it off again
- in frustration, said, ""why are all these curdling?""
- went back to fridge and put whipped cream on again but this time successfully

WHY DID YOU NOT PREPARE THE CUSTOMER ANOTHER BEVERAGE AFTER THE FIRST ONE WAS HIT WITH CURDLED CREAM?  SCRAPING IT OFF WILL NOT MAKE IT RIGHT!

A couple things distinguish this Starbucks. The Clover machine makes it worth a visit; the staff make it worth a return; but the clientele *might* make you want to get out quickly.

1) Its staff is usually phenomenal -- friendly, efficient, engaged. I think they're among the best in Toronto, and I imagine it's a tough Starbucks to work at.

2) Its clientele is unique. This is the heart of Forest Hill, so this outlet is often teeming with wealthy adults and students from the nearby girls private school. The girls tend to come in hoards at specific times and they seem to order labour-intensive drinks. So, if you find yourself at the end of the line at 4:00 on a weekday, expect to wait a little while. The adults are interesting because they are particular, demanding and 'important'; they know what they want and they want it done right, now (before their idling double-parked Lexus SUV gets a ticket). This is a caricature, but spend some time here and you may find that it's not inaccurate. This clientele also goes to show how special the staff is, because they manage to get so many of these types in and out quickly and satisfied.

3) The Clover. This is one of the few outlets in Canada offering Clover-brewed coffee. Starbucks found the machine so impressive that the corporation labelled it a game-changer and purchased its manufacturer. It looks to be the size of an amplifier, and costs more than a cheap car. It makes a individual cup of the coffee blend of your choice, right before your eyes, and it's very cool to watch. It involves an up-and-down moving filter, a boiling-water spigot, a vacuum suction, together in what might seem to be a Rube Goldberg apparatus. The barista grinds your coffee, the filter lowers and the grinds get dumped in. That part gets filled with hot water and mixed. When it's ready (and this internet-connected machine is so smart, apparently, that it gathers the optimal timing, temperature, etc. for each blend), the filter rises and falls as the perfectly-brewed coffee is vacuumed out. The result is a truly delicious serving of the coffee blend you really wanted (and they offer a few specialty blends to try, Clover-style). According to the Starbucks website, Clover's innovative design ""lets you discover new layers and dimensions within a coffee's familiar aroma, flavor, body and acidity."" They claim: ""We're pretty sure it will be the best cup of coffee you've ever tasted."" I tend to dismiss statements like these as puffs but, in this instance, I think Starbucks might be right.

A Clover-brewed coffee will set you back a bit more than an ordinary cup of brewed coffee: $2.45 for a Grande Verona, and for the reserves, $3.45 for a Grande Ethiopia Sidamo, or $3.95 for a Grande Blue Java. See if you like it. IMHO, it's totally worth it, once in a while.

4 Stars? I'm working on a 3-star baseline for Starbucks generally. The staff and the Clover bring it up, but the after-school rush and the occasionally-inconsiderate customers take it down a little bit.",1,-soqdQNpLjb1SzYlXnzKVw

It also seems like it would be a nice place to hold a meeting with co-workers or bosses. There was a group beside me who did just that, and one of the men expressed his surprise at the heated underground parking (I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear. I swear I wasn't trying to eavesdrop!) 

It's also convenient for people who don't drive, because it's located in York Mills Centre which is part of the subway line.

This Starbucks is pretty small, its long, narrow, cozy, and the coffee bar takes up 2/3 of the space therefore leaving space for only limited seating. I've been here a few times with no place to sit so most of the time I come with the intentions of getting my caffeine fix to go. The plus side of this location is that in the warmer months they do have a lovely long patio with more outdoor seating than the interior provides.

This late Monday night however it was pretty vacant but I wanted my goods to go anyhow. Unfortunately they were out of my favourite treats, the Oat Fudge Bar and the Mini Red Velvet Whoopie Pie. As per recommedation of the barista I decided to give the Cake Pops a go. For drink I stuck to my favourite tried and true Vanilla Latte.

Vanilla Latte - Espresso and steamed milk, with Vanilla with syrup.
I asked for it extra Hot and although I drove home (10 min ride) it still remained pretty warm with a nice layer of foam still intact. I also like to make use of the shakers and sprinkled some vanilla and chocolate powder on top. Overall they make a consistently good starbucks aprroved quality latte.

Rocky Road Cake Pop - Chocolate cake and icing dipped in a dark chocolaty coating, with mini marshmallows and roasted almonds.
I thoroughly enjoyed the cake pop!  A super moist chocolate cake encased in a dark chocolaty shell topped with marshmallows and crunchy almonds. It also had marshmellows and almonds on the inside too! It's the perfect treat if you just want a bite sized sweet.

So I settle for the peach tea but they don't always have that one in stock because they are out of comfort tea people have been ordering the peach instead so sometimes I am out of luck and they have neither. They did offer me hot chocolate instead with a ten cent discount, imagine that 10 cents off in place of a tea that cost me nothing as it is incorporated into the cost of the $50 tumbler. This is the second year a friend gave me the tumbler for Christmas, this time I wrote him back and thanked him but encouraged him not to bother next year.

But this place, like almost all newly built Starbucks locations, purposefully designed the air conditioning vents to be directly above all the seating. At all times of the year, winter being the most heinous, they blast cold air at customers. They do not turn this off in winter no matter what... even if it is -15 outside with cold air blasting through the doors...  the cold air is still blasting from the vents... customers are complaining... it doesn't matter.  This has lead me to conclude this is an active, corporate decision to make customers uncomfortable so they won't stay very along and allow more customers to flow through. 

If you look at all the newly built Starbuck locations, the one close to Kingston and Midland among others, all of them follow this same format. Vents directly above the seats, blasting at the customers. If there are any tables in the middle of the room, there are also vents directly above each of those tables. It is ridiculous and a pattern I've seen at many new locations. 

I love the drinks, but it is clear at the corporate level they are treating customers like cattle and don't want them to be too comfortable for too long. Get in and get out! Which is hilarious since Starbucks helped mainstream the concept of lounging around a coffee shop on a laptop or with friends. The classic Starbucks couches have essentially been erased from existence at this point. 

Years ago they started publicly talking about how they wanted to ditch that and I think this is an example of how they are trying to thwart long hang outs. Turn the customers into ice!",0,GuHR1yDvYMpTcqQpBOwc9w

Coming from someone who worked in a customer service background in a restaurant where I had to do a lot of cleaning, this was always a no-no, and we always had to wait until customers were not present to do any kind of sanitization. 

I tried the new vanilla chai tea latte which was a bit too sweet for my liking so going forward I'll definitely stick with the original chai tea. On top of that, I initially got a small but immediately took it back because, I'm not kidding, only half of my cup was full. Upon picking up my cup, I could literally feel that there was almost nothing in there. If I could feel it without even removing the lid, obviously the person who made it could as well so she should've topped it up without me having to ask her to do it.

The staff are generally cheerful, helpful, and most importantly for this franchise, never have any problems with accommodating anything I've ever had customized beyond what size and flavour off the billboard. (My biggest peeve with this chain was how they had ""Short"" versions of all their drinks, but did not post it as an option on their ordering billboard. I found that practice quite shameful but, since I've not ordered a regular short for a while, who knows, maybe that's not even an option anymore. *Note to Self: Buy a short regular brew coffee and find out ..) For that reason alone, I'd have rated 4 but since I didn't place a Short order, I'll not punish this one actual store's review.

This is one of the locations that has a the prime real estate corner in a commercial tower, so you get the outdoor patio tables on a nice corner of Yonge Street. It's also quite spacious on the inside, so you have a real slew of options for the seating arrangement you might have preference for when you come in. I'll hope the Yelp pictures already posted for this store are adequate for an overall look at the place without actually going in since I don't tend to take photos for every review.

Meantime, I've always had great service here and I've never found it unacceptably untidy or dirty. So long as their baristas and service staff keep up their part of the experience, this location's a great one in my Yelp book.

I'll give it a full 3 stars though because the baristas here are friendly and they make the drinks at a lighting fast rate.  I've seen line ups go out onto the main path outside, but the wait is rarely more than a few minutes.

Overall a nice stop for that quick coffee, tea, or frappuccino.  Also if you have that office party and forgot to buy someone a gift, there's a nice little section with cups, coffee bags, tea, etc., which would make the perfect gift for that caffeine fiend!",1,mFwRTTDW0Yr-rFkTF2cFsw

Although being at the foot of Ossington means this Starbucks has lots of competition in the coffee shop department, I have found myself here time and time again. 

The split levels and large communal table make this an inviting place to work, and, as a writer, I have found it to be a source or great inspiration. I once witnessed the quiet unfolding of a relationship here, the tale of two lovers unravelling while sipping clover pressed coffees, a unique addition to this location, as they wiped tears away with winter mittens. For some reason it is an image I often remember when I find myself here, often on Sundays.  

The crowd at this location is mixed, but usually its people working on laptops or college and university students studying notes. I feel surrounded by people working on great pieces of work and it gives me the impression that something magical happens here. The staff are incredibly polite and always smiling, and the music is soft and subtle, though often quite coffee shop chic. This Starbucks is unlike any other one in the city (at least that I have visited) and as far as the chain is concerned it's kind of in a league of its own. It's lovely grabbing a seat by the window and watching snowflakes fall along queen street west, or simply heading upstairs to sequester yourself on the balcony with headphones and hot coffee. 

I am tempted to give it 5 stars because it really is quite lovely, but Starbucks coffee itself is certainly not my favourite brew along the Ossington strip.

Having said that, I am not above dropping by one if I need a hit of Joe-on-the-go and I do appreciate that at least they try to elevate the experience of coffee chains, however, I do find them overpriced overall. 

So basically, what really sets them apart in my eyes is their decor, yet this location is a cookie cutter as they come. The main advantage of this location is that you WILL have to come in if you do not like the Tim Hortons across the street as they are the only nearby competition.

THIS location is the THE best Starbucks location I have ever been to, in twenty years of hanging with the green mermaid.

Some locations like the one in downtown Ann Arbor have an wicked ""lower level"" where students can hang out.  There's a location in West Virginia where everyone behind the counter is singing.  I've paid $12 for a Latte in Bern.  I've seen angry baristas arguing in front of customers; I've seen smooth baristas work under immense pressure (and constant flirtation) in the middle of a Pride Parade; I've even seen the lead singer for the Cranberries introduce herself to the guy who starred in the Austin Powers movies over tea.  

Nope.  This location is the best of them all.

The service here is way, way better than average.  To a person, there is a consistent and persistent commitment to friendliness that, even by Starbucks's standards, is superb.

Back when I used to attend the Toronto International Film Festival regularly, this place was my basecamp.

I'd party until 3 or 4 AM, walk from wherever I was (usually the Thompson Hotel) back to this Tim's and crash there for a couple hours until Union Station reopened and I could catch the first train back to Port Credit.

Since then, it's been a favored destination whenever I need a snack. While it does have some issues that keep it from attaining greatness, it's still a choice spot to hang out and grab a sandwich.

It's clear that the people who designed this location understood the flow of nearby foot traffic, because the interior is one of the most expansive I've seen in a Tim's. It may not look like it from the outside, but this place has the capacity to handle a good 100 people or more who are lining up for food. The place is also kept fairly clean, as I watched employees zipping around cleaning tables and making sure junk was kept to a minimum.

Service is hit-or-miss. I find it's better to come late at night or early in the morning because there isn't much traffic. When I visited (as of this writing) yesterday, the staff looked like they couldn't care less. I ordered a BLT combo from an employee who wasn't sure where I should line up to get it, and when I did line up, I nearly got annoyed because the woman making the sandwiches flagged my order as completed when there was still one part missing (potato wedges).

Like others have said, the main reason why this location doesn't get a 4- or 5-star rating is because of the squatters outside the store. Whenever I visit, there's usually at least one man begging for change and yelling at people outside. If you're going to enter here, there's a back entrance just off York Street in the alley that's easy to access.

Well, perhaps this one is it. This is a newer location which pushed out a local store, and I would say it's actually rather nicely appointed.  It's a space that gets a lot of light that looks both modern and comfortable.

Now, I'm not sure how the chain which is at the pinnacle of corporate homogeneity can fail this badly on the staff and service side, but 4 out of 5 visits here have had some sort of problem, namely:
--The staff can't work the cash register...significant delay involving all 3 employees.
--The staff member can't figure out how to work the Clover machine...wasn't there some training for this?
--My drink was completely forgotten.  Actually they made it and forgot to give it to me, but by the time I got someone's attention it had been sitting around a while.
--They're somehow out of the first two things I try to order, including the medium roast Pike's Place coffee...this just doesn't happen at Starbucks usually.

Now, most of the time in a Starbucks, I think they're taking some corporate dispensed Soma (cf. Brave New World), as they're sort of unreasonably happy and friendly to be serving grande lattes.  This location, however, has apparently not gotten their shipment in, and I've encountered some of the least happy staff I've ever seen.

They've been open 4 or 5 months...I would figure Starbucks has the new store process down cold, but this one is a definite miss.  Have no fear, you have alternatives to this mess:
1) Another Starbucks, just a half block away (you can actually see it).
2) 3 more Starbucks within a 5 minute walk.
3) Golden Min: a cute little local shop that does excellent coffee on the corner of Yonge & College.",0,VnKj044Tt5doqaVDIJbWsw

This places is awesome - I love the space and the cleanliness they maintain during the morning rush - I imagine that if they can do that while trying to eliminate the maddening lineup, they can do it any time of the day and in the wee hours of the morning, it is IMMACULATE.

The food here is pretty good - things are baked and prepared to my  expectations, I have yet a problem. I like that the staff smile; don't say much often but they at least smile. In the night time they even chat a bit which is nice, because I have done my time as an overnighter in a Tims and other places and it is NOT easy to keep eyes open let alone smile or chat . This was particularly heartwarming as my last dealing with overnight staff at a different Timmies was disheartening.

ONE beef: why are there so many homeless /panhandlers crowding the door to this place? I feel awful walking out with food and no change to donate or even giving a dime to ONE and not to the other 5 that crowd this rather tiny entrance

I gave Tim Hortons a 2, not a 1, since the sandwiches didn't make me sick- they were simply nasty. Also, the sandwiches were cheap so I didn't blow a lot of money on them.

After taking my order ( frapp with bacon breakfast sandwich) team member A at the register proceeded to stand there & chat with team member B while the guy training was left to make drinks alone.  I get my sandwich, 2 new customers come in. A takes the order & goes back to chatting with B.  New guy makes all hot beverage orders, ignoring the fact I was there before 2 others, then asks B  how to make my frapp.    Finally get my order after 11 minutes & as I'm leaving see the team member who was on break jump on the register & tell A (who is still just shooting the shit with B) to help with drinks.  I get outside, take a better look at my drink & can tell the consistency & color are all wrong.  Take a sip, disgusting, but no time to go back.

I was there 2 times the same day last Sunday. I went few hours apart in between. Sadly, I had the same person that served me for my 2 visits. He was one of the worst Tim Horton staff I have ever encountered.

He had the following characteristics that really angry me....
- he rarely looked at people's eyes, and his face was not facing customers but facing other directions while taking customers' orders
- his one elbow was on the counter
- he had no smile
- treated every customer the same using all of the above
- there was this saying right on his face that day that said: ""WHY AM I STILL HERE? I COULD BE MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LIKE A CEO""

I seriously don't know why he is working at Tim Horton if he dislike customers or the job so much. Maybe he should find another job and at least he could make him self feel better without this ANNOYING LOOK.

Admittedly I am pretty basic, so obviously I have to be definition love Starbucks, which I do. I like that they accommodate almost any dietary restrictions you may have, which is important for a franchise popular among us basics who start a new diet fad every few years. They have sugar-free syrup options for those on a low-carb diet, they have almond, coconut, and soy milk for those who are on a vegan diet, and obviously their beverages are gluten-free.

Many of the Starbucks locations can get busy from time to time with the number of people taking up spots for hours at a time. No complaints there from my end because I'm one of those people, but it sometimes does lead to some odd people hanging around from time to time, especially at night. They're just odd, not dangerous so it's really not that concerning. The strong wifi at Starbucks also attracts many people as you don't even have to order a drink to use it, which can sometimes cause issues if the network gets too congested, as it might prevent you from accessing the web.

The online ordering option has been great for those with a really complex order to appease their sophisticated palette. It's also been useful for times when there is an enormous line so you can just sit somewhere and wait rather than having to stand. I find that it's often not great for ordering food, as they often say they have something on the app which ends up being out of stock in the store - but it's useful for ordering drinks.

I decided to review this Starbucks because it's the closest one to my place and I needed to write more reviews before the end of the year. This location in particular is somewhat different from the other locations as they are larger and offer a selection of reserve roasts. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means though, so I wouldn't be able to tell you what's good coffee unless it was really awful. Although it's the closest location to my place, it's not my most visited as it is often quite crowded so it's not the ideal Starbucks location if I'm looking to just grab and go. The Longo's down the street has a small Starbucks that almost never has a line so that's usually where I go for a quick pick up. Nevertheless, this is a good Starbucks location if you're looking to kill some time and prefer being in the middle of a crowd.",0,FejMS4vsD9FIUtiwsmm7mA

2.  Nice patio if you can actually get a seat at one of the 4 tables
3.  75% of people have Macs (well at least 50% - probably common in the neighbourhood)

Also, baristas are cool... went in late one night to ask for a breakfast sandwich... oven was already turned off I was told... only sandwich left was Thai Tuna wrap which I remarked did not really sound all that tasty... Barista gave it to me for FREE which was cool (as would spoil anyway).

Starbucks.... At once I loath it for what it has done to convince the general populace that ""gourmet"" coffee must taste overroasted and otherwise damaged, I must also admit that it provides a necessary public service that might otherwise be unavailable-- a predictably warm, semi-comfortable, passably clean environment in which to recharge your laptop and get free wifi. 

Well, it's also an acceptable place (I'm running out of adjectives that mean ""mediocre"") to meet up with some friends or kill some time, get out of the rain/snow/sleet if you are not a postal worker, etc.

Wait-- what am I doing, everyone already knows what Starbucks is, I mean my iPhone even autocorrects me when I don't capitalize the ""s"". How is that for ubiquity? It doesn't even capitalize the ""m"" in mom (don't tell my mother).

So basically the above is a semi-rant against the ""man"" ruining something that I think is ""cool"" and ""counter-culture"". I feel like a hipster. No wonder everyone hates hipsters.

Anyways, this location is nice and spacious, wasn't super crowded when I went (around 6 pm on a weekday), some comfy looking couches that I didn't sit in because I think it's weird to sit directly beside a stranger in matching couches.

They knew what a ristretto is, but only because there is a button on the machine that says ""ristretto"". 

And so, before I launch into my tired old rant against buying ""gourmet"" ""espresso"" from a barista whose entire training consists of locating the ""start"" button on a super-automatic espresso maker, I will end this review.

It's located around the Bloor and Yonge area just a little south of the Toronto Reference Library. It's a pretty big Starbucks with a fair amount of space with good table to chair ratio.  So this is definitely a good spot to go study especially if the Toronto Reference Library gets too packed.  The decor looks like a modernized library but not over the top where you can't recognize it anymore. There's a large communal table in the back of the store which is great and perfect if you need a lot of table space.

I normally come here as a quick pick me up when I'm in the area. On this occasion, I got the Zen green tea which by their description is a green tea that's combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon.  To me, it's pretty much a nice mint lemon green tea. And something that distinctly makes Starbucks Canada different than the rest is the readily available honey. That's right Billy Bee's honey which is Canada's favourite honey is available in Starbucks locations all over Canada. So whether you're battling a cold or a scratchy ailing voice, I find the mint lemon green tea with a good amount of honey helps.

So overall, I like this Starbucks location as it's a little different from the rest. It helps to support overflow from the library well.  It also has a fair amount of lounging area for those wanting to take a break from shopping, studying or just to find a place to chat away from the busy streets of Yonge and Bloor.

You get your drink as expected but I find that most recently with the new hires they tend to lack the attention to detail that some of the other stores possess. Numerous times I would have to have my drink remade because they forgot that it was either lactose free or I paid for something extra. This has been occurred so often that I have to watch the barista making the drink to ensure that they use lactose free instead of regular milk. 

Another example that I've witnessed a lady storming out after waiting 20 minutes for 2 sandwiches, which they did not have in stock. (I had been waiting for awhile at this point too).  The only thing the staff could say to each other is: ""should we have given her a gift card?"".  At any other store, staff would be well trained enough to recognize that they messed up.

Don't get me wrong - customer service is still okay and they never get my drink/food wrong. But there are just many reasons why I would prefer a different location (which I'll list below).

My school is directly above this store, so this place gets packed with students and staff at any given hour. I recommend you use the Starbucks app to order in advance so you can just pick up at the bar. It came save you anywhere from 15-30 minutes! There's also not much seating here. There's a few seats inside the rather small store (always filled with students), and a few tables outside the store.

One time I came here during frappy hour, and it was a huge mistake. It was already summer holidays, so there were barely any students on campus, and it still took about 30-40 minutes. The line moves fairly quickly, but the wait for your drink is way too long. Another time, I had called because I wanted to ask the manager a question regarding Starbucks sponsorship and the person I was talking to rudely said he would not tell me if the manager was in or when he/she would be in. Another time I had forgot to ask for a cup of water with my drink so I asked at the bar and I kind of got attitude about it.

TLDR: went from my fav starbucks to the one I try to avoid in the past year 

My mom was visiting from out of town and I took her here, boasting about how nice the neighbourhood is and how friendly and welcoming everyone was. 
It's fall and my mom never gets starbucks so it's a treat. She ordered a grande iced pumpkin spice latte for herself, when the barista asked if she wanted whip my mom said no thank you. Then the barista turned to me and I asked for a grande pumpkin spice frap please, and when she asked me about whip I said yes please! Then we ordered a loaf slice and croissant and paid. 
We sat at the bar table nearest the counter where they put the finished orders. My mom got her latte nice and quick ""pumpkin spice latte for alison"" and we waited for my drink. I'm more people came in and I say her put down an americano, a coffee and another iced latte. 
I was waiting patiently for my frap telling my mom about how it tastes like a cold slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream noticing that the other latte was still on the counter...but it couldn't be my drink that's not what I asked for. It deff had to be one of the other customers standing around or a mobile or something . Then after all the other drinks are taken I see her double check the latte cup, roll her eyes and then dump it and half ass rinse out the cup. She then made my frap in that cup. A moment later she called out ""pumpkin spice FRAPPICINO no whip"" and set it down then walked away from bar. I was like wait what? And I could see my name on the side of the cup. 
I'd already been waiting 10 mins since my mom got her drink and didn't wanna make a stink about it but  was disappointed.

They have a Clover machine and a variety of different reserve coffees to try. They can be kind of expensive, anywhere from $4 to $5+ for a short with tax.

They had all recently had a tasting and everyone was very excited about the Jamaican Blue Mountain, which is an extremely rare coffee. I got one and it came to $5.30 with tax. I didn't like it as much as I liked other Clovers they brewed. I think the Blue Java is one of my favourites, and that one's a bit more affordable. Sometimes, depending on the variety and possibly the barista, I can either drink it black or I have to add dairy. Crema, the independent coffee shop that shares a space with Freshii just a bit south east of this one also has a Clover machine. Those are the 2 Clover machines I know of in the city.

Overall, this is one of the best Starbucks I've been to in the city. I love the option to get fancy Clover-brewed coffee. The staff's positive energy is also very welcoming but as a disclaimer I must mention that they were all wired up from a coffee tasting.

Pros:
- Drive-through
- Lots of seating 
- Summer patio

Cons:
- Inaccurate orders
- Limited parking 
- Atmosphere feels claustrophobic 
- Not enough seats for demand
- Very busy 

This location has a drive through, which makes it convenient to pick up a beverage on-the-go. The only problem is, they have messed up my order multiple times and I noticed after I drove away or when my migraine begins 30 minutes later because the employee used sugar-free syrup instead of the original one with sugar. 

Tonight I visited this location and dined-in at the cafe for the first time. The interior wasn't like the other Starbucks locations I frequent.  It reminded me of a school cafeteria and the windows were covered with black blinds to hide the hustle and bustle of Yonge street. Furthermore, the interior made me feel claustrophobic.  This is saying a lot considering I normally don't experience claustrophobia.  Once we sat down, and I stopped looking at the black blinds, I felt okay. 

One benefit at this location is the their summer patio. It's looks like a great place to sip a beverage during the warmer months. During the colder months, this location is too crowded because they don't have enough seats to accommodate the mass volume of guests who frequent this location. 

Due to the mass size of this Starbucks, there isn't enough parking and it is really noisy. In the future, I might just consider this location for the drive through but I'll have to follow up with many questions to ensure they don't make my order incorrectly.",0,X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ

I suppose not equipping the garden doesn't harm the business of this Starbucks at all, but if it is theirs for the operating, it seems a shame to let such a lovely space in such a busy spot (across from the YMCA) sit idle and unused, I would guess by withholding furniture or unwillingness to monitor or clean the space.",1,r0GLQAawvHXUd-xZow-fWQ

One of the employees, Lisa, who had the joy of serving this person, handled the situation very well, didn't escalate with the guest, served her drink and let her be on her way.

She just kept demanding that it's not working, asking if I even have any balance in my Tim card- she made me look like those awful customers who give people a hard time when I am far from that. I myself work customer service jobs so if anything, I am always more than kind to people in the same industry. She was the one being difficult, there is no reason you can't manually type in the Tim card number or let me pay with the other cashier. In the end, the man before me insisted to pay for my order, which I declined but he kept insisting.. I suppose there are still random acts of kindness in the world.",0,0dYKgUz-v_RYZQxFfheMyw

Everyone knows about Starbucks and their omnipresence is sometimes unavoidable when you need coffee, the Internet and a place to sit. But I discovered something interesting last time I was here: this Starbucks has a Clover Press. BONK!

It's true. The Barista was actually quite knowledgeable about the fancy vacuum press technique and suggested a pretty good brew. This brings Toronto's Clover count to three, along with Crema in the Junction and Manic on College, and the price for a cup is comparable.  Now, I'm not devoted to the technique, but it does produce a decent up of joe. Good to know, right?

Obligatory Title Pun: Actually worked out to THREE-BUCKS.

Menu Readability: Zzz.

Need to mention: I love watching the Clover press in action.

I ordered my current go-to drink, a tall blonde almond milk vanilla latte using my Starbucks app. This location at College and Euclid popped up as being one of the nearest locations with the advantage of having street parking out front (unlike many other locations on my route to work). 

The cafe was quiet as one might expect at 6:15am and this location has ample seating. There were two very friendly baristas who greeted me, asked if I wanted a bag to carry the yogurt parfait I picked up on a whim, as well as took the time to let me know my use of the Starbucks app and timing of pickup was ""well played"". I was able to enjoy my drink less than five minutes after ordering it via the app. My latte was hot and perfectly made. The yogurt parfait (which I enjoyed at work) was just okay as it had sliced peaches (similar to those from a can) and raspberries but some of the granola was already soggy. However I'm not sure one can fault the individual store for this.

If you experience poor customer service and it's not resolved with the on site manager then write to corporate and you'll be rewarded usually with a free drink.

Also they have a reward system that rewards you on your birthday and gives you freebies the more you visit. 

The Starbucks here in Canada are different from the States because here most of the stores don't have a drive through, they're smaller in size and the staff are not as warm.

If you're looking to get a little work done (and you're like me, who found Crema a little too crowded and with no available place to plug in my laptop), this S'bux has a number of tables and a fair amount of power outlets with which you can plug in your hooptie. Wifi is decently speedy (No password needed, all you have to do is accept T&C). On the other hand, the back room was too dim on this cloudy day (the light bulbs there don't give off a lot of light), so it was hard to spend any meaningful amount of laptop time. Baristas are nice, and the bathroom is decently clean.

There is a Tim Horton's in the mall, but otherwise, this seems to be the only coffee shop in the area. The staff said the store has been open for 1.5 months. There is lots of parking in the plaza because there are still some shops that have not been occupied. This location is quite big and wasn't busy when I was there, but it is on the bus line and will likely be a busy spot in the future.

The shop has a modern feel, closer to the Reserve location look than other Starbucks I've been to. There is seating around the windowed perimeter and in the middle, although none of it looks particularly comfortable except for four armchairs. There is bar seating by the window that looks like it would be good for doing work because the bar is spacious enough to have a laptop and some papers or books. There is a fairly large patio on Overlea that will be nice in the warmer months.

This location has Nitro cold brew on tap. The staff offered a sample to me and it was creamy and quite good! There is an area to pick-up app orders. Everything else is standard for Starbucks.",0,bQkGxjnCChgZ0RG6ygSJFg

That being said, this Starbucks is pretty beautiful and I've had nothing but the friendliest service when I do come.

The atmosphere is unique just like many of the other local cafes so such an extent that its easy to forget you're at a Starbucks. The seating area in the back of the cafe is as homey as you can get with a large repurposed table, smaller tables to seat two, and a cozy couch with a low table situated right in front of a fireplace. It's the perfect for winter.

The cafe does well during the warmer months as well with a large side garage door that opens up to let the fresh air in. Unfortunately, this large garage door doesn't get opened much anymore and keeps the cafe closed off from the busy intersection. There isn't as much of a patio scene at this Starbucks either. There's plenty of space between the cafe and the sidewalk, but it's rare to see any more than one table out there. It's a huge shame and completely unlike any of the other Starbucks you would see in neighbourhoods like the Annex.

Basically was a regular donut stuffed with vanilla custard, with a little bit of crispy crème brule torched sugar on top.  The crunch was nice, but the donut was only OK.  Nothing special.

The timbit cone comes with 4 timbits so you can try one of each kind. The fight have the birthday one so I tried the cookies and cream (lacked flavor just tasted like the plain timbit) the coffee cookie crumbles (had ZERO coffee flavor) truffle (if I to choose my fav which had a chocolate base)

The pick up area isn't spacious like Starbucks, there is a long table in the middle so there is nowhere to stand. Everyone is bunched up together and having to ask everyone to move to grab something. They also don't have straws (which is fine) but change the cups spout if there's ice in it. I couldn't get any of my drink because of the spout and ice kept getting stuck in the way. 

Drinks: tried their Nitro brewed coffee (They gave this to me by mistake), Nitro peach mango iced tea (this is what they were supposed to give me) tasted garbo. Strawberry Rhubarb iced tea was really good though! At least they made one thing right. 

Food: I wanted to try all the donut flavors but so glad i didn't. It was only about 5:30pm and they were sold out of almost every donut flavor there is. So we opted for the timbits and tried each flavor. Dude these are not new timbit flavors. They literally just took the same old timbits they had and rolled it around in cookies or sprinkles. So innovative. 

Birthday Explosion: Honey dip timbit covered in sprinkles
Cookies N' Cream: Old fashioned timbit covered in oreo cookies
Chocolate Truffle: Chocolate timbit covered in chocolate shavings
Coffee Crumble Cake: Sour cream glazed timbit covered in i dont even know what that was. 

They all tasted.. really dry and actually i think some of them would have been pretty good if it wasn't so dry. If you hadn't bought a drink and purchased just their timbits.. you'd definitely be buying a drink after that.

Service & Cost: The service was bad. This woman was so confused with our order. We asked for the Nitro peach mango iced tea and she instantly without blinking said ""we don't have it anymore"". An exact second later she turns around looks behind her and then turns back and says ""oh yes we do"". So we were like okay that's fine, cool we will take that one. When we got our order it was so dark in color i was thinking if it was just coffee with hints of peach in it. The picture i posted these drinks have not been touched yet. That nitro coffee (what we hadn't ordered) is literally that size only. We ordered a large which ended up being smaller than a small drink. 40% coffee, 60% disappointment. We took a look at the receipt and saw that is not what we ordered and went back to the same cashier. She looked at us saying ""me? i was the one that served you?"" and she looked extremely angry like we drank half the drink before saying it was the wrong drink. No we did not drink it. That is how it came out. She went to the barista area and started complaining to them. And without even whispering we can hear them talking among each other. Extremely rude. They did end up making the correct drink for us (which also tasted very bad) and we left. I will not be returning.",3,yWJWOGTVp8peyfllOydVRg

The new drinks on the menu are different from what is served in a normal Tim Hortons and provides you with a whole new selection of beverages to choose from. The Iced Matcha Latte had a lot of powder in it and it was not mixed throughly so the bitterness of the Matcha came through. 

The donuts were super delicious, my favorite one was the Peanut Butter and Jam donut! The timbits on the other hand were disappointing as they took their existing timbits and just mix and match the flavor profile to call it a new one. The birthday explosion was a regular birthday timbit with chocolate inside. The Coffee one was the old fashion timbit with some coffee flavor.

It's not the best Tim's out there. It's not the Promised Land. What this location (billed as the company's first ""innovation cafe"") basically boils down to is ""Starbucks, but cheaper"".

I don't understand why there were hundreds of people waiting in line last Thursday (as of the writing of this review) for the grand opening of this branch, located at the base of the Exchange Tower at 130 King Street West. They know the donuts are still frozen and reheated in-house, right? Despite the impressive-looking setup in the back, it's still the same routine as any other location.

That being said, there is a lot to like about this location. To start with, there is quite the selection of items for sale - much more than your rank-and-file Tim's - including Crème Brûlée and Maple Bacon donuts, iced teas, Nitro Cold Brew coffees, Timbit Ice Cream Cones and an impressive selection of other items. Going in here on its third day of operation, it absolutely was going strong, with long lineups, impressive visual presentation (big pictures of Tim Horton himself on the wall, but where's the love for Ron Joyce, who just passed away?) and a fair amount of seating, considering the crowd.

I picked up a large Peach Mango iced tea ($2.79) and managed to find a spot at the bar and began looking around the place. This is undeniably a preferred hangout for people, even this early in its existence. You'll have people buy boxes of high-end donuts to sit around for two or three hours with their friends at one of the tables, backed by some really comfy red-and-brown low-backed chairs. The staff are extremely eager to please, with the manager herself (I think she said her name was Cindy) moving deliveries herself, dealing with customer complaints and talking shop with other business reps, while a horde of staff members floated around the place picking up litter.

This location feels like a child caught between two worlds. If you are coming in here to order something, be mindful about the lineups - there are two different set-ups. If you are ordering just drinks, you have to wait for people in front of you to get to the order counter and pick their sandwiches, designer donuts, etc. then move on to a nearby set of cashiers further down the line. (Not helping matters was the woman who cut in front of me after she'd ordered a sandwich behind me.) The location is very competitively-priced, with most drinks capping out at $4 or less. The most interesting thing, to me, are the menus placed on tables so that you can see some of the coffee selections before you go up to order.

This is still early days, so there's a lot of room for refinement. The lineup situation needs to be worked out, but the selection is admittedly impressive and I didn't notice any major hiccups when I visited. In an area where there are a horde of coffee shop options - there's even another Tim's less than 100 metres away from here in the Exchange Tower concourse - this will definitely help them stand out, and they seem to be gunning for Starbucks with their pricing setup.

I have a feeling this location will be around here for a long time - smart design, quite interesting menu choices and a very relaxed atmosphere will definitely keep me coming back.

Well worth a look.",2,Jb13QyXGi0zD4ZtSTBQwpQ

They had about a dozen different donut flavours with each donut costing 1.99 or a dozen for 18.99. I bought 2 dozen of assorted variety back to the office and was truly disappointed with how certain donuts were just slighlty elevated from their original ones. I.e. the birthday confetti one just tasted like their old fashion donut with a smack of pink icing alll over! Also tried their timbits and there was only 4 different ones at this location... the dark chocolate one was probably the best one out of all of the other 3. Once again... its just a regular timbit glorified. A box of 20 was 3.99. I also ordered a matcha latee iced and was not pleased... they essentially added matcha powder and milk into a cup and stirred. The taste was more milk flavoured than matcha which i was disappointed with. Within an hour of having that drink the matcha powder sinks to the bottom and i felt i was left with a light green drink that tasted like 2% milk. What also upset me about this tim hortons is that they hsve no bags to carry your dozens of donut! So coming to pick this up for work was very difficult to carry back without any form of bags... unlike san remo bakery or even krispy kreme make sure you hsve some sort of big enough bag for anyone that wants to buy lots from the store!

He said I was spending 'too much' time in his establishment without buying enough. I asked him when, specifically this had occurred and he could not answer the question.  I find this manner of direct abuse, particularly after writing a fantastic review of his store very, very insulting.  The man has Napoleonic control issues and has zero difficulty whatever applying that approach to what WERE his loyal customers.

As far as this particular store's grossly offensive policy is concerned, I believe it is coming directly from Mr. Darrell Smith's controlling anus and not from his obtuse employer, Starbucks.  Never have I heard similar at any other Starbucks. It is a patently ridiculous statement/demand.

We ordered an iced matcha latte, coffee, and 10 dream timbits. Firstly,  service and organization needs improvement. I used the self serve station to place my order electronically and waited at the crowded pick up area for a long time for the timbits. I inquired about my order, which the cashier rudely told me that I was ""supposed"" to tell them my timbits selection in person in addition to my mobile order. This seems to be very inefficient as there were no signs or indication of this at the self serve station and the customer would have to line up twice to place their order. They should have a feature to personalize the timbits order at the self serve  then.

The iced matcha latte, as others have said, was extremely watery and filled with powder that was not mixed properly. It is shocking to see Tim Hortons charging Starbucks prices on their drinks, if the quality is not up to standard. 

The ""dream"" timbits were nothing more than regular timbits with huge chunks of chocolate bits added to it. It tasted much sweeter than their regular timbits, and it was hard and not fresh. Also, the staff packed and stuffed all the timbits in a super tiny box, which was pretty ridiculous. The timbits obviously did not fit and were all squished together in an overflowing box. I didn't notice this until the cashier gave it back to me, and didn't want to make a big deal out of it. 

Overall, I did like the seating environment as it is very modern and open. However, I wouldn't be able to tell that this was a Tim Hortons as it just looked like any other cafe.

Ordinarily, to grill a sandwich, isn't butter or mayonnaise supposed to be spread in a restrained amount across the outside of the bread slices? None was. And, adding overdose to omission, instead of the usual dollop of dressing on the inside, mayo was slathered on in great copious oceanic quantities from a free-flowing easy squeeze bottle, atop one single slice each of turkey and cheese. During the grilling process the cheese failed to melt and the mayo, of such there was too much to start, failed to meld with the other ingredients.

The result? A BLT, without the bacon, lettuce, and tomato, but with a crest of mayo so humongous a surf-boarder could have ridden it to score a competitive victory.

I was wrong.

A couple of things, I place 3 separate bagel orders on 3 different occasions and none of them really came out toasted, but people using the app, just want their order in a hurry.  When I complained about this the owner said the bagel is cold because the cream cheese is cold....I can't think of another place that's toasted a bagel, and served it cold.  That's just physics-defying to me.  Also, I have had toasted bagels before...so that was totally bizarre.

The last straw was ordered a box of tim-bits via the app.  The filled the box with 50 plain and sugar covered plain tim-bits as ""assorted"", when I complained and asked for a refund, they told me to wait...like 15 minutes for them to put some sticky not fully cooked chocolate ones in.  (not additional, just in the box).  It was pretty gross.

The Tim Horton's complaint process is such that the owner of the franchise gives you a call back to discuss.  In this case, he sided with the manager ~ who feels that this is a good resolution to my complaint.  I do not agree.

I'm not sure if this Tim Horton's is always bad, but I know that all 4 of the 4 mobile orders I places were unsatisfactory.  As a result, I don't think I would try it again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.

There was a group of us waiting patiently at one cash counter. A couple walked in & sat down across from an empty cash counter. One of the associates opens the cash counter & instead of asking who's next in line he starts to serve the couple (who came after the 6 customers already waiting).

The large counter extended from the long side of the space, leaving only a narrow area for tables. 
I expected more couch type chairs in here for some reason, so that I can read my book for the next half hour - instead I was sitting at the bar stools trying to understand this place. 

Despite being super narrow, they have to also put a display of coffee in the middle of the walking area, creating an even tighter space. 

Also annoying is that all the coffee fixings like lids, sugar, cream is off to the back end of the space, forcing you to squeeze yourself beside all the folks waiting for their drink, people trying to get work done at the tiny tables, and the stupid coffee display. 
The worst part is that, this area isn't even close to the exit. All they need to do is move it to the other end, where there isn't a crowd waiting for their drinks and make it convenient for everyone. 

Even better, is if they took their entire counter space and try to fit it along the far wall - leaving the rest of the open space for people to sit.

Not that I would ever be able to go to every Starbucks within the GTA. Those things sprout up quicker than...well, actually, Starbucks is metaphor enough for speedy cookie cutter duplication isn't it?

The intersection of College & Yonge is always buzzing, so this location is constantly under hectic caffeine junkie traffic. It is directly across a very gentrified looking Tim Horton's. Both stores have their work cut out for them.

A busy cafe really defeats the point doesn't it? We imagine cafes as a place of relaxation, of contemplation, intellectual conversations, or if you're a hipster; free WIFI.

The constant traffic renders this location to be loud, unsettling, and claustrophobic.
Surprisingly, it takes the same amount of time to make a beverage when compared to any other location. Thus can be argued as efficiency, or a lack thereof. 
Being able to turn out drinks at the same speed despite the high demand is impressive, but shouldn't that give them sufficient experience to be able to make drinks more quickly than usual? Anyway, this isn't a complaint, but rather just an observation.

There is always a fight for loitering space by the area where you wait for your drink to be made. I guess the only point to make is how busy this place is.
It gets better after 8pm, but who the hell drinks coffee after 8?

I made a girl wait for me for over 30 minutes here while I attended an opera.

I come to this Tim Horton's every morning during the week without fail as its one of the most convenient on my way to work. For quite some time when I first started coming here, they were bang on. Always got my order right, were fast with the lines - no complaints. That's all gone to hell in a handbasket in the last little while.

It's generally a crapshoot as to whether I'm going to get one of the quiet cashiers, who politely takes your order and says nothing else, or one of the two RUDE cashiers, one who doesn't listen, gets distracted and walks away from the cash, leaving you with no one to take your order and the other who yells at the next person in line like they're deaf and didn't hear her the first time (even though there WAS no first time being called out). 

Either way, my order is frequently done wrong and its not a difficult order. I get a medium steeped tea with two cream and one sugar. Often I get more than one sugar, or no sugar, I've gotten it with milk before and I've gotten coffee as well. I cannot STAND coffee so nothing is worse than taking a sip of a hot beverage you're looking forward to, to find out its something disgustingly unwelcome.

My food order is more often than not wrong or not even filled. I get an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an english muffin. I've had them try to give it to me with meat inside, with egg white inside (which has an ingredient I'm allergic to in it, hence regular egg), on a bagel, on a biscuit. And sometimes they just neglect to fill it. Don't understand how you can let me stand there long enough to have ME ask ""where's my order"" and then NOT fill it right away.

Not to mention that at any time of the day, the restaurant is FILTHY. I came here last night with a friend who wanted a tea and every single booth and table was dirty and it was NOT busy. Oh and the fact that they seem to allow homeless/crazy people to sit in the restaurant and yell obscenities at women like myself while I'm leaving is utterly inappropriate.

I have no idea why he would do it, but he did.

I moved over to wait for my drink - A Grande Non Fat Chai Latte - when my drink was put on the bar, the barista called out my drink, but I didn't hear it well, so I repeated ""this is a non fat chai latte right"" to which she said yes.  Maybe I just trust people to much, but I grabbed my drink, popped the lid on it and walked out the door.  it wasn't until i got on the subway that I realized she had made me the wrong drink.

If I wasn't in a grumpy mood already I would have just thrown out the drink - but I needed my Chai and I couldn't justify throwing out a $5 drink.

I really, really don't like to diss places for a one-off less-than-stellar service moment - it happens, we've all been there - but I was kind of dumbfounded today, so:

There were only two people working, one one the cash and one preparing, and it was busy, so I was willing to cut these servers some serious slack. When both of them started taking forever helping one customer decide what to have, which involved a breakdown of what that customer had tried before, what ingredients they like, sweetness levels, etc., I tried to appreciate the high level of attention paid to the experience of that customer. But then I started losing my patience because I noticed that that degree of attention to one customer produced a very noticeable lack of service to myself and the other customers in the ever-growing line-up. Still, everyone was very pleasant, so what's a few minutes, and then a few more.

I finally made it to the front just as 2 MORE servers came out from the back - I was like fuuuuck, finally. Just starting their shift? Or taking breaks at the same time even though it was so busy up here? They each did some punching on the registers, then proceeded to chat with the original servers and wander here and there instead of focusing directly on whittling down the line-up (I was still at the front of the line and still hadn't ordered).

But just because I've heard quite a few comments about the quality of the donut or whatever, I thought I'd share my googling on the subject (maybe this is all common knowledge but maybe you haven't read this yet). As of 2002, the chain moved from having the stores ditch all in-store baking equipment in favour of microwaves. The donuts are partially baked in a plant in Brantford and shipped frozen to be microwaved on site throughout the day. So if you used to like Tim Horton's donuts and can't figure out why you don't like them so much any more that is why.

Also the ""homemade"" chicken noodle soup that they serve at lunch is definitely powdered and rehydrated. One bite of the shrivelled peas and carrots in the soup and it is obvious.

You either love it and spend loads of money on its overpriced drinks or you loathe it and say it is crap. Well this review has nothing to do with their drinks. However there chocolate chip cookies were delicious.

The review is about their bathroom.

On a cold Easter Sunday in the late afternoon, my brother and I had just finished partaking in a few cold adult beverages at a nearby bar. Drinking yourself silly on Easter is what former practicing Catholics do on this day. Anyway, we wind up leaving and head back out into the windy and brisk Toronto air.

Five minutes into walking we both need to desperately pee. Yes drinking excessive amounts of alcohol will lead to excessive amounts of urine children. So we do the painful pee waddle looking for a bathroom, as our hotel is a pretty far walk from where we currently are located.

A few restaurants would not allow us the bathroom since we were not customers. So we walked into the massive Eaton Centre hoping to wizz in their lavatories. Unfortunately it was late Sunday and a holiday, so the mall was 20% open for business and all bathrooms were locked.

I had never been so worried in my life. Was I going to piss my pants in Toronto? Would the Canadians laugh at me with their silly accents? Why did I down that extra pint of chocolate stout on the way out of the last bar? Why am I asking so many questions?

Finally we decide that it is either let it flow on the streets of TO or get to our hotel asap. Along the way like a beacon of hope with a toilet, there was Starbucks. As we walk by, there it is...glowing...shining...simply amazing...a bathroom door! I sneak in and try to use the room without buying something, but to no avail. It was locked! So we each buy a cookie for $1.50 CAD, which I believe is -6 cents American and were granted access to the bathroom

15 minutes later my bladder is finally emptied and there is a line outside to use it as well. Must be a pretty popular bathroom locale when the entire city shuts there john's doors. So yes you can come here, get a frappa-crappa bs drink or a cookie...but I highly recommend this 10x20 sanctuary of shitters when you need to go.",9,hGeXKYWkqJgFC1u_Sh6kCg

Two of the employees scolded me for recording and taking pictures without their permission.

Of course if I was filming or taking pics of them directly, I would ask for permission but I was just filming the place and they just happened to be in the shot like barely in the background. Like I said, I know some people can be sensitive and I could only apologized for making them feel uncomfortable but lecturing me like as if was an paparazzi and intentionally filming them as I was being a jerk was not cool.

They ask you your name for the order, like another popular place, but I've never heard them use it yet, although this afternoon, I heard them greet a customer by name, ""How are you today, Bob""?

There's a nice small table in the corner with leather lounge chairs beside a beautiful faux fireplace and TV mounted above.

So why only three stars?  A few reasons: 
* I agree with fellow Yelper, Romana H. It's confusing to know how to line up in there.
  
* It's pay parking only, Tim's should implement a max 20 or max 30 minute free parking, I don't want to have to pay for parking if I only have to run in for a few minutes, as there's no drive through

* There's a sign on the counters saying the neighbourhood is special and they offer soy milk as well as lactose-free skim milk, on the sign the word ""neighbourhood"" is misspelt in a way that I as a proud Canadian shopping in a proud Canadian establishment am deeply offended by.

One of my favourite things about this place is how the staff sing out when something fresh is putting put out and then the rest of the staff echo it back.  All in all some nice touches make this location standout in the chain.",2,aIRuPE2Us54uKB8iKMmuwA

I hate to give this place such a low-star review because it does have some really good pros such as:

-open late! I work in the area and the other two nearest starbucks close between 9-10; I can always count on this one to be open when I need a more late-night 'bucks fix
-super convenient location! just steps from college subway station
-very friendly baristas!
-they give out more of those ""take this receipt, fill out this survey, and get a free drink"" offers than any other starbucks that I am aware of

But the one con for me that really tanks the rating is that they get my order wrong more often than not :( Seriously, I think I had my order wrong 4 times in a row once. All I ask for is a Tall White Mocha - not too difficult! One time I walked out of there with a cup of steamed milk. STEAMED. Milk. No espresso, none of the white chocolate pump. Just milk with some whipped cream on top. I am not really sure what went on that day!

Note that this place is usually packed during peak hours, and usually quite busy in off hours too.

No, but seriously this is a good one and should be noted. I've come in here several times and have always been met with a smile, proper drink and a welcoming vibe all around. But last night holds an experience I want to sing about!

I had a paper due and wanted a change of scenery so I packed up and came here. Immediately I see that I am not alone; many other have chosen to do the same thing as me and work away from home. This leads me to feel comfortable enough to save a table by an outlet (it's not too busy) and order up a drink. I won't comment on how the drink was- caramel macchiato, you know already know- but the seasonal gingerbread loaf was quite moist and yummy with delicious cream cheese icing on top and candied/gingered orange rind sprinkled on top. Pretty! 

I got it For Here because I was planning on camping out for a while. I wasn't sure if they still did this but I was so happy to hear the barista say, ""I love it when people do that and save the environment"". Look at me. I am single-handedly saving the environment as I enjoy my coffee and cake off china. Who doesn't want to do that? If you want to save the environment, this is the way to go. 

It was a five star Starbucks experience if not for some serious cardboard box messiness towards the back. Perhaps garbage day was soon but there should be another place to put the accumulation. I got a ton of work done though! I found it to be just the right place with mild volumed music, people but not too many, great service, caffeine and snacks for energy.

I really enjoy the bagel BELT at McDonalds so I thought I'd give it a try here at Tim's but at lunch. The cheese was not melted at all and overall the egg and bacon didn't seem that hot either. Hence why the cheese hadn't melted at all. Seemed to be lacking any kind of spread on the bagel as well which was needed since the cheese wasn't melted... it was fine but I wouldn't get it again and I'd rather go to McDonalds but it was a cold day and this place was convenient.

But the worst part of the experience was the bathroom smelled like someone had died in there and peed all over the floor after said death. I really had to use it so I tried to not touch anything and got out out there as quick as I could.

However, for this visit I came with the intention of trying the new Beyond Sausage Lettuce Tomato biscuit (made with a Beyond Meat patty). I've tried a Beyond Meat burger before and thought it was pretty good.

The Beyond Sausage biscuit was decent. It doesn't taste like it's vegetarian, but also doesn't taste exactly like meat. My biggest complaint is that they go a bit heavy on one of the spices to give it that sausage taste, more than used with a normal sausage patty. It's nothing I would go look for again, but if I'm stuck going to a fast food place I might get it again.

It looks to be a little lower in calories, fat, and carbs than the normal sausage breakfast sandwich, plus a little higher in protein. So something to consider if you're counting carbs and calories.

I liked the Beyond Meat burger I had at a different place more than this sausage version, so if you have a choice between the two I'd suggest the burger.",0,Hqi2L4h_F1RgUwawfWI5Sw

Looks like this is kinda Canada's version of the ubiquitous McDonalds except that they expand on the mega chain by adding pastries as well. And the even got breakfast, very similar to what you would see in American fast food chains. So, I really wanted to see what the food was like at one of these places since they seem to be the most popular eatery by far here, and so I got breakfast...

1. Canadian Back Bacon Breakfast Sandwich C$3.49:  So yesterday we got these amazing!!! special corn meal rolled pork sandwiches and I thought this was gonna be like that, just calling the meat something different. Nope... Just was what we Americans would call ""Canadian bacon.""  But let me tell you this thing is sooooo horrible!  This is pretty much a Egg McMuffin but with Canadian bacon.  But it sure did not taste like one!  The ham is so dry and tasteless. The eggs are also dry. The whole thing is dry and tasteless. Sorry to say it but any McDonalds breakfast sandwich is 100x better tasting. 1/10

2. Flatbread Breakfast Panini C$2.99: So despite the fancy name this is basically a Sausage McMuffin but using the thin whole wheat bagels you can get at the grocery store store. First off it's not a Panini. But ignoring that, holy sht, this one was so bad that my gf couldn't even eat 1/2 of it!  The sausage has got to be the worst sausage we have ever tried. Soooo amazingly dry. The whole thing was like cardboard. 0/10

I dunno. I really don't understand what the deal is. There were like 10 people in line waiting to order. What the hell!?

They use to have a great service and a wonderful team always in a good mood and work so well together.  After the renovation, management changed and most of the previous staff were gone.  Even though the manager tries hard, she is often found yelling at her staff and being very disruptive.  The staff don't work as a team and often on their toes.  Every week, the staff changes and so there no continuity and no way to build a team.
 
The worse complain I have is the fact that they have stopped brewing blond coffee after 11:00 or 12:00 which is extremely frustrating.  I love blond and find pike too harsh.  I don't enjoy it.  I do have the choice of getting pour over but it often takes time as someone has to manually do it and the store is often busy.  So I end up getting pike and not enjoying my coffee as much as should be.  I asked 3 starbucks in the same area (on Queen) and they all brew blond until 4 or 5 pm.

In 1967 Horton partnered with investor Ron Joyce, who quickly took over operations and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar franchise. He also bought out the family interest after Tim Horton's death in a car accident in 1974. As a result of Ron Joyce's aggressive expansion, independent doughnut shops in Canada had been virtually eliminated and Canada's per-capita ratio of doughnut shops surpassed those of all other countries.

I was unimpressed with marble slab considering the prices and the same goes for cold stone but I dislike this place slightly less and if I had my ice cream craving and this place was around, I'd definitely go for it.

No need to give a detailed account of what kind of ice cream they have, but in a nutshell, they have several basic flavors of ice cream and they just mix in other stuff like cookies, chips, nuts etc when you order to give it a whole new theme.

Tim Horton's has partnered with Cold Stone Creamery to do this in several of their locations.

Since everyone knows what Tim Horton's serves (cheap bad coffee and sub-par baked goods), I went here to evaluate the ice cream.   Cold Stone Creamery specializes in serving their own ice cream, but you get to choose your ""mix-ins"" which they mix in to the ice cream on a cold slab.  I opted to go with something simple - the smallest size of peanut butter ice cream - no mix-ins.  It was pretty good - not the richest most flavourful peanut butter ice cream that I've ever had - but tasty and enjoyable none the less.  The serving size is quite large for the smallest size in my opinion.  I believe my ice cream was $3 plus tax.

Their menu displays a bunch of ""Signature Creations"" such as (continuing on the peanut butter theme) Peanut Butter Cup Perfection (chocolate ice cream, peanut butter, reese peanut butter cups, and chocolate sauce, served in a waffle bowl).  Yikes - I would like to try this but only if I have someone to share it with.  It's clear that this place is loading on the calories, even for an ice cream shop.  As a matter of fact, Cold Stone ""won"" an ""award"" from Men's Health magazine recently.

I really enjoyed the decor. They had a huge wooden table that would be awesome to study on, if one didn't have to share it with 5 other strangers. They also had a small wooden bar table that ran along their large windows (seats 5?), which was really great to sit at and watch the rain outside. But overall, they really could use some more seating arrangements at this location.

The baristas were average at best and I can see that the location wouldn't be convenient for anyone other than the condo dwellers and government employees during the day.

The rustic wood theme is really well done and comes together nicely. The new seats are comfortable, and the entire space feels larger.

If you do get lucky and find a seat, its a good place to have a conversation. 

Sometimes, the people sitting next you join in on the conversation, I kind of like that- It's a bit North European, where everyone is seated so close to each other that you have cross talk. At the same time, when you do want to have a private conversation with someone, it becomes challenging as everyone is seated closely. 

On a positive note, despite the location busy, the washrooms are kept clean. Thats one thing I like about Starbucks, you an expect a clean washroom in most of their stores.",2,zFnKCjSDTrvMquk2YtmXOw

I told her I asked for a frappe and she immediately fixed it. Upon receiving my drink, I took a sip and it tasted like their was milk in my drink I walked a block to meet a friend and bring her back to the Starbucks. In this time, my stomach began to hurt and I was sure there was dairy in my beverage. I asked the lady who made my drink if there was dairy in it and she discovered the mix had dairy. Eeks

She was super sweet and offered to make me a new drink. I opted for the go-to (a matcha coconut milk frappe with a pump of vanilla) and she remade my drink as a venti and offered me a banana as she knew it was both gluten and dairy free.

This employee went above and beyond to make a negative experience better and she apologized for the lady who took my order, who told me the drink was dairy free. I would return to this location but would definitely ask the lady who helped me if the drink I'm ordering is in fact gluten and dairy free. 

One negative is the washrooms smelled pretty bad at this location but the lady who helped me in the end was absolutely fantastic and one of the better Starbucks employees I have conversed with. 

Thank you for turning a negative experience around!",0,X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ

How do I know he left to smoke?  Because he then stood amongst the designed Starbucks patio furniture and had his smoke break right there and then.  Wearing his Starbucks' worker T-shirt.  Does he not know the rule about smoking x-amount of feet from the door/patio?  

2) I go inside and am behind a man and his child who order the most complicated drinks on the menu, plus two paninis with specific grilling instructions.  Of course, now the one idiot behind the counter is the only one who can make these drinks and the food, because I am staring at his co-worker outside smoking.  All I want is a tall Pike.  Just pull the lever down and fill the cup, and let me hand you my toonie.

3) I get my Pike eventually, and go over to the milk and sugar station, where now there are only two canisters - one says, ominously, ""MILK"" and the other ""CREAM"".  What type of milk?  What type of cream?  I go to the counter and ask the one poor schlub, ""What kind of milk and cream are out there?""   

""The cream is half and half, and the milk is 2%.""   

""What if I want non-fat milk?"" I ask.

""Well,"" he says, ""you have to ask for it.""

Even though the manager tries hard, she is often found yelling at her staff and being very disruptive.  The staff don't work as a team and often on their toes.  Every week, the staff changes and so there no continuity and no way to build a team.
 
The worse complain I have is the fact that they have stopped brewing blond coffee after 11:00 or 12:00 which is extremely frustrating.  I love blond and find pike too harsh.  I don't enjoy it.  I do have the choice of getting pour over but it often takes time as someone has to manually do it and the store is often busy.  So I end up getting pike and not enjoying my coffee as much as should be.  I asked 3 starbucks in the same area (on Queen) and they all brew blond until 4 or 5 pm.

This place makes the worst drinks of any Starbucks I've ever been to in either the US or anywhere in Canada...and I've been a regular at tons of Starbucks over the years. They completely rip you off. How is it that when I order the exact same drink at this Starbucks it's always significantly more expensive here than any other Starbucks in Toronto I've been to (including the one down the street from this location)?? They put so much ice in their drinks here that when they scooped it out bc they forgot I'd ordered it without ice I was left with literally one-third of the cup full. They put so much foam in their drinks I couldn't even find the liquid...when I scooped out some foam the latte only came up to halfway of the cup. Their frappuccinos are foamy which may sound good on paper but is actually disgusting af...iced capps from Tim's are less than half the price and have a nicer texture.

Despite his death in 1974 due to a car accident, his memory lives on through the beloved Canadian chain of Tim Hortons specializing in affordable and delicious coffee and donuts. When in Canada, it is essential to stop by a Tim Hortons. They are EVERYWHERE!! :) 

This location of Tim Hortons is a Hall of Fame special edition Tim Hortons since it is located right outside of the Hockey Hall of Fame. You can see jerseys displayed around the business in the Sam Pollock Square. On the day that I visited, there was even a Tim Hortons backdrop that I proudly took a selfie with!! 

I had a Maple Dip classic donut ($0.99 CAD) and a medium Original Iced Capp ($2.99 CAD). My Maple donut was perfect!!!!! It was the perfect amount of sweetness. The donut to glaze ratio is on point. I also really enjoyed the Iced Capp on the hot record breaking heat day that I happened to be visiting Canada. I really need a Tim Hortons near me in the states. I love Tim Hortons so much I am already ordering their brand of coffee off Amazon. 

In addition to being tasty and affordable I feel like Tim Hortons is engrained into the Canadian culture. When it is playoff season I know that this location of Tim Hortons even has limited edition Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jay donuts. That must be exciting for the strong spirited fans. 

Also the service was perfect. The lady who was helping me was the sweetest soul!! It is true what they say -- CANADIANS ARE SO NICE!! I love Canada!! 

My only regret is that I did not buy any Timbits. These are the Tim Horton's special donut holes (what we call them where I come from) and I heard that they are amazing. It was so early in the day and I didn't want to hold it all day walking around downtown Toronto so I couldn't get it. *sigh* It's okay though, this just means that I need to fly back to Canada ASAP!! ;)",58,W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA

THE BLACK AND WHITE: I stayed at an airbnb close to this Tim Horton's while staying in Canada, so I frequented this place often. I had to see what the fuss was for Tim Horton's since I've seen it in so many of my favorite Canadian Youtubers videos. And in short: Too sweet.

I normally get a small black coffee but I was intrigued by the latte. It was bout $2.70 CAD and only came in one size (I think it was a medium). The top of the drink was good...but it got super sweet the further down the drink I went. I have a sweet tooth but not when it comes to my drinks. Same went for the mocha ice coffee...which was suppose to come out in ice cubes but the people behind the bar blended it.

The carrot cake muffin was absolutely delicious. In the middle, there was sour cream icing which just topped it all off. I would have to say, that was the star of the order. 

Perk! This place is open 24/7. Thank you Canada!

Having said that, I have a few reasons I don't particularly enjoy Starbucks in general, and, more importantly in this case - why I didn't find this one particularly appealing.

First off ... it's located in the most foo-foo-y-est mall I can think of, i.e., Bayview Village. This mall for me is where I go not because anybody knows my name; but, because I expect to go in and enjoy a leisurely, foo-foo-y experience that only the Yorkville of the North, this mall, can give me. And I have to say ... this Starbucks does not fit into that description!

It's insanely crowded ... a paying customer can't find a seat anywhere. As per any other (s)Tarbucks ... good luck getting a table, any table, with half the patrons taking up every single spot only with a coffee, and their computers/books/business materials/blah blah. So yeah, there's definitely that and then some, at this location.

The coffee, well, I don't find it amazing, but, given that that is personal taste, I can't say that would round more than .5 a star. (In this case, down the .5 star for Starbucks.)

Last but not least, lining up for the bathroom, too? And a setup that makes the winter months particularly miserable for moving around its tightly packed L-shape? UFF!

No thanks. There's an Aroma, a Lettieri, and a cute little Bread & Roses cafe, not to mention David's, and a million other places to get a decent coffee in the mall.

Update: Aramark runs this and unfortunately, they've gone to two lines instead of one to give the illusion of a shorter wait. Don't be fooled; the wait's just as long, even longer if you pick the slow line :-(

On a freezing cold February visit to Toronto, and after hearing the hype, I told my boyfriend that getting a Tim Horton's coffee would definitely be on our to-do list (we're from Atlanta). Finally got around to it on our way out of town. The cashier lady didn't seem to speak English very well, or at least had a difficult time understanding us (we were probably talking too fast. Canadians seem to speak slowly.) I saw coffee and also 'vanilla coffee' on the menu board, four sizes (?), all very inexpensive relative to Starbucks. I asked if the coffee grounds themselves were vanilla-flavored, or did they use syrup. Not sure why I asked because either would have been fine, but her answer was something like 'powder.' Hmm. They gave us our drinks and we looked for the cream/sugar station - no where to be found. We asked another worker and he hesitated to give us Splenda saying it was already very sweet. Um... ok. Well, it turns out that ""Vanilla Coffee"" = ""Vanilla Latte,"" very similar to the kind you can get at any gas station in the US out of a hot cocoa like machine. Ugh! It WAS VERY sweet and incredibly hot. We drank it, along with our sweet Canadian Maple donut, but left feeling ill, OD'd on sugar. 

I told my sister this story, who went to school in Niagara and is familiar with TH. At times she is passionately critical, and I don't necessarily agree with her, however this was her response: ""Yeah, I should have told you, don't order ANYTHING from TH's, no flavored coffee, no cocoa, not frappe drinks, no donuts, JUST PLAIN COFFEE.  It's AWESOME, everything else straight sucks....""  Ugh.

Long story short, my Tim Horton's romance was not what I had hoped it would be. Figures. Had we had another day, I would have tried one more time and gotten a plain ol' coffee.

Two nights in a row, 15 minutes before this specific shop closed, this location didn't want to serve anyone in any way involving effort.

The night before, on my way to work, I stopped by with the intent of getting a Frapp to go. I was told, ""I'm sorry. We turned our blenders off for the night. Can I offer you a tea or some coffee or something?"" I politely declined and left.

The next night, I came by about the same time. Staff were inside. I could see them. I tried the door and it was locked. There was NO SIGNAGE WHATSOEVER explaining why they had closed up early. The staff ignored me.

Why should I find out if a third time's the charm? I asked Starbucks staff at a DIFFERENT location WITHOUT implicating anyone. ""If you need to close your shop early for some reason and lock the doors, do you put signs up explaining this?"" They said of COURSE they do so people understand they're not simply lazy and wanting to quit work early. I then recounted being told that the blenders had been shut off so they couldn't make a Frapp for me. The staffer smirked and whispered, ""They bullshitted you. They just didn't want to have to do any work at the end of the day. Sounds like these guys don't want to work very hard.""

This was said to me by staff from a DIFFERENT Starbucks. ACTUAL STARBUCKS STAFF, not just my friends I'm passing off as staff or an outright lie all together.

The thing was I barely took that long to make my order. She wasn't listening to me as I had to repeat my parts of my order multiple times. I didn't know combo meals were able to get any drink on the menu (I'm from America, we don't do that around here lol) and she gave me an attitude about ordering drinks as if I should automatically know they do this. My GF told me she rolled her eyes at me after I looked away from her while taking my order... This is as extremely unprofessional as it gets; luckily I didn't catch that or there would have been a bigger issue at hand... Anyway, the drinks came lightning fast (although they were probably the most weak coffees I ever bought), and the food came along. I ordered 4 breakfast meals and 2 regular sandwiches. So it should have been 6 sandwiches, 4 hash browns and 4 drinks. I was missing 1 drink, the lady told me it wasn't on the receipt.
   The cashier tries to convince her co-worker that she went over the entire order with me, meanwhile she did not whatsoever. I couldn't believe she straight lied in front of my face about it, but I laughed it off. To my defense, I told them I never mentioned the word ""Hash Brown"" in my order so how did I end up with a 4th Hash Brown if I hadn't ordered 4th meal? I ended up getting the 4th drink free but it was a huge hassle and I did not like how the cashier was acting at all. 2 stars cause the lady gave me a free drink, but service was remarkably bad and would have been 1 star otherwise.

However while I was sitting, drinking my bevvie, snacking on some veggies from my purse, I saw a group of teenaged girls come in from the high school across the street, and order three waters.

They are (honestly) constantly yelling, screaming and laughing. Many of them who are off shift come and sit with the ones who are working. Even getting a tea is a production - one worker made me wait while he showed his coworker the snapchat pictures he was sending to a tinder date. Another worker ran out of the store chasing an employee who left, yelling that he didn't finish his jobs. Everyone in the store either stays for 5 minutes or they have headphones in. It's absolutely the most unprofessional place of business I have ever been in, and it's unfortunate because Starbucks is one of my favourite places and I need to study in a coffee shop every night.

The staff are simply amazing here. It is easily one of the busiest locations as everyone gets off the Go Trains and are funneled into the PATH system in front of this location. I go 1-2 times a day (for the last 2-3 years) and I can honestly say I have yet to see someone have a bad day and slip on customer service - incredibly rare!

If your a regular, they make a point to know your name and drink. they just say Billy - would you like your Grande Skinny Mocha? This is not just one or two staff members, it's everyone. When you see the manager in action, you quickly learn why the staff are so good, she is incredible and winner of Starbucks Manager of the year award multiple times.

They have three people working the cash when its busy and they take your drink orders while your still in line. By the time you pay, your drinks are ready and waiting for you. Don't worry if you see long lines, they move quickly.

Bonus - they are opened on Saturday and Sunday, great for people working on a weekend in the Financial district.

This location recently re-opened because they were closed for renovation. It's much more bigger with many seats and the wait time is quicker because they have many barristers to take your order.

However, the drinks haven't met my expectations. Compared to the Dynamic Funds building, their drinks are less bitter but there's still some consistency problem. My favorite drinks are latte and flat white. 

Latte
- less bitter but not too sweet
- extremely foamy
- I always order Tall, but I don't know why the weight feels ""lighter"" 90% of the time? They don't put the same amount?

Flat white
- bitter 
- foamy
- fail to give me the ""white dot"" so I end up paying more for a ""latte"" because of the extra foam.

Apparently new corporate policy wants to charge for additional water needed to fill larger cup . Despite no additional cost for them they essentially want to charge more for tap water ..

This in itself I was never really a fan of but worst of all was and still is the night menu... which should be called hot beverages menu because that all they offer at that time. Although this location advertises 24hrs it really only serves the majority of its menu for 12-14 of those 24hrs. I can't tell you how many times I've asked for a donut... any donut... a bagel? Nothing! Just coffee or tea and I'm sorry but that's just silly. If it's a matter of losing money then shut down during the night but otherwise customers are being presented with a menu that they can't order 95% of!

These things I became used to and even found a way to work around but now the quality of service has dropped signifcantly and that has really affected the way I see this place.  Not all are bad and I will say I find the daytime staff a bit better but still the friendliness, efficiency and quality has taken a huge hit. I should not be naming names but I think this employee is outstanding, Sheryl I believe her name is, still has to be one of the kindest people I have met so she is the only reason why this establishment is getting more then a single star from me. 

I want to like this place as I am often forced to go there as it is on the way home but I have to say that I am growing tired of the sour faces, unstirred coffees,  wrong orders and fighting for a parking spot with picnic groups!",1,qtQOOYU5Ucyr0p3DnnS1LA

About the only thing I liked is that they have a little bar set up for people to sit and chat next to the baristas which is kinda of different. It could also be argued that they are so low on space that they had to improvise outside of the box.

I have never seen this drink before, so I had no idea what it's suppose to look like, but the name looked pretty obvious.  Matcha and lemonade.  Either way, I'm watching the barista make this drink.  Milk and matcha powder mixed together with ice, and then he pours lemonade into the drink.  I thought this was weird(lemon curds milk), but I was in a hurry and I just assumed these guys were just following instructions from Starbucks recipes.  Tasted weird, but my fault for trying something new.  I was going to write this off as a bad call, but on the TTC ride home, I am actually seeing the drink curd.  Little white clumps are forming in the drink!  So I research the drink online.  MILK was NEVER suppose to be in the drink.   I've been having a stomach ache for a while now.

There was a time when I loved stepping foot through your yellow framed double doors. Inside was a rotating cake display, friendly old ladies, fresh donuts and coffee strong enough to stand the hairs on your neck straight all morning.

Now, it's an assembly line with big screen TVs and the least attentive staff in the world. But, that's not my issue here. It has to do with packaging and waste. Tim Hortons, you simply blow me away with your waste.

My order was a soup and sandwich combo. The soup comes in a small waxed cardboard bowl with a plastic lid. This is placed into a waxed paper bag. The sandwich is wrapped in waxed paper, then placed into another bag and then put in the bag with the soup. To eat the soup you need a spoon and I guess a knife for some reason. These GET THEIR OWN BAG and are placed inside the first bag.

With that solid strategic decision made, the cab driver rolled up in front of this Tim Hortons, which is open 24 hrs.   

Inside the Timmy's a serene vibe reigned: there was a man eating a bagel, another asleep with head down on a table, and a third reading the paper.  We were able to immediately sashay (why not?) up to the front, where one lone employee manned the counter.  

The dialogue was simple:  

We asked, ""what's your freshest donut?""

""They are all fresh"", the dude-in-brown-uniform responded.

Whereas I might normally dock him a few points for being surly, I kinda appreciated the early morning grumble and the fact that he wasn't picking favourites.  So we ended up with muffins and a box of Timbits.  Efficient, inexpensive, inandout without racking up too much time on the taxi meter.

This Starbucks is located in an indoor shopping center that is actually located below ground and only a few feet away from underground subway system. I was surprised to discover when visiting Toronto that there are a great deal of business that operate below ground because of the frigid winter temperatures.

I found this Starbucks to be no different than the rest, there were no specialty drinks sweetened with maple syrup (Canadian joke). What I could order in the States I could order here. The staff working was top notch, efficient, friendly & fast with service. I ordered a decaffeinated cappuccino with steamed soy extra wet and was provided in a very timely manner exactly what I had ordered.

After receiving my drink I was given the option of two separate condiment sections both of which were quite large and clean which is even more important!!! After adding a tad bit of cinnamon to my drink I had the option of sitting inside the Starbucks which has an open feel to the naturally lighted concourse area or sitting outside. I decided to sit and do some people watching which was quite hard everyone still seemed to be dressed like Eskimos.

I did however enjoy while sitting in the open concourse section and looking up toward the ceiling which was a work of art. The glass structure that houses this indoor mall spared no expense when it came to creating business with beauty.

The floor in which my chair was sitting on was made out of lightly smoked glass cubes which I thought looked nice. It was not until later in the afternoon after visiting and exiting the Hall of Fame one floor below this Starbucks did I realize that the glass floor I was sitting on was the ceiling for the floor below. So when visiting this Starbucks and/or walking to / from the folk's one floor below can see basically your image passing by, it was quite neat.

Just like other Starbucks this one offered 'free' WiFi. If you are planning on visiting this location plan on arriving either by subway, bicycle or taxi because there is no parking around.

But this one at Gerrard and Jones, is one unlike the others. No really, it has a lot of personality built into it. Crazy, yes, that it struck me oddly that this visit is a very unique experience for a mere ubiquitous international coffee chain that normally employs uniform interior design standards. A metamorphosis really, when compared to the cheap greasy spoon this property was previously where I once regularly bought $2 chicken burgers for lunch, in a rather unremarkable-and-unglorious-yet-slowly-gentrifying stretch of east-end Toronto (I'll spare y'all the ancient memories--the Starbucks that it is now bears absolutely no signs or semblance of its former past, but lest I digress..).

Be at awe upon walking in. This location is decked out with a series of unique wall murals, lighting fixtures, and furniture, including very comfy chairs upstairs. A bookcase and communal table anchors the south front. Plenty of power outlets for all you laptop-in-a-cafe fiends. And upstairs, you'll find they've carved out a spacious patio. The atmosphere is warming enough to want to make you want to live here instead, or feel like you're in a fancy cocktail lounge and not a chain cafe. Very cozy.

I'd imagine this Starbucks would be packed during school hours--it sure must be a blast for the RCI students across the street to study and hang out here. But in the middle of the afternoon during an intense summer heat wave, I had the whole patio to myself. And for a moment, I felt like the king of a castle.

Before this Starbucks popped up almost two years ago, I visited Starbucks once in a blue moon.  So what's the allure behind this location that puts it above the rest?  Is it the drinks?  Not necessarily.  The food?  Well, Starbucks food comes pre-packaged, so no, not really.  The location isn't highly attractive either.  It sits on the corner of Jones and Gerrard, sharing the intersection with a high school, a dingy corner store, and a poorly ventilated Pizza Pizza.  Outside, it doesn't seem like much, but walk inside and be wow'ed.

The store itself is sleek and modern, but feels like home.  There are two murals, one on the wall beside the staircase and one on the patio, done by a local graffiti artist.  My favourite part though, is the bookshelf.  Maybe it's the bookworm in me speaking, but it definitely boosts the cozy atmosphere by 110%!  It stretches from the bottom of the first floor all the way up to the ceiling.  A bookshelf is not complete without books though!  There are dozens of books lined on the shelf, free for you to read as you please.

There are plenty of seats, but typically during busy hours and on weekdays from 3pm - 5pm, it's almost impossible to find a seat because they're taken by rowdy high school students from across the street (no offence, but teenagers can be loud).  Other than that, the place is fairly quiet, but not too quiet that it feels like the fifth floor of the reference library.  No worries, you won't be shunned for speaking!

What makes this place my favourite Starbucks though, is the service.  Never have I ever on one of my plentiful visits received bad service.  The baristas are always kind and understanding.  Even when the line of indecisive teenagers flows in during the lunch hour, their cheerful moods never falter.  Sometimes I wonder if specially selected workers with A+-worthy customer service skills are hired for this location or if we're just plain lucky!  So if you're looking for a Starbucks with excellent service, this place is perfect for you!  The baristas never fail to impress.

The outdoor patio on the second floor is also an added bonus during the summer.  With plenty of seats, relax and enjoy your cold drink while basking in the sun!  It definitely beats lounging indoors!",2,Hyro9mRdNtU2hJlkQjVq4Q

I'm not a huge Starbucks fan but I do prefer their drinks over timmies. Anyways, I have a few comments about their beverage itself and the cleanliness of the place in this review. 

During the summer I usually order their refreshers, my favorite being the strawberry açaí, so I ordered that. While they were making it, I walked to a vacant table to take out my laptop and set up my work station for the next hour or so. Their tables were... not cleaned. They don't wipe them.. and they don't brush off any crumbs of any sort.. the side of the table have drip marks and I just couldn't touch any of it. I know maybe campus kids are gonna be messy and unhygienic, but as a big franchise and for the price I pay, I have seen other Starbucks baristas wipe their tables every hour. 


My drink was done but when they called my name, I really thought that wasn't my drink. My drink was so diluted it was bright pink, but most importantly it has no dried strawberry pieces in there, so I would never guess it's mine. When I took it I asked them, ""um.. doesn't this have the straw-"" and before I can finish my question he already knew what I was trying to ask BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE DRINK CONTAINS?? So he replied, ""..strawberries? Let me ask."" He came back and said ""sorry we ran out of the strawberries."" I hope he knows without the strawberries it's like drinking latte without milk.. it's not really called a latte. I'm literally just drinking diluted juice out of a carton with ice branded with the Starbucks logo. 

I have been to other Starbucks locations where the drink was sold out but they already charged me, so they offered me a free upsize of other drinks, and there was even a location in indigo that offered me a free danish. I am in no way implying I only look for free stuff, but when they actually put an effort in customer satisfaction because their drink was sold out and they took my money already. I call that effort. 

I stayed around 30 minutes just sitting and reading, but during the 30 minutes I overheard at least 2 customers complaining about the service. One was the cashier overcharging a customer for a drink she didn't order. The conversation lasted about 5 minutes and involved all the baristas clarifying and realizing their mistake in the end, but they didn't even apologize. The other was something about using the wrong cream/milk. 

Overall, I would not come to this location again since they don't even have the courtesy to tell me that they ran out of a part of the drink and ask if I mind it or not. They just passed me my drink and acted as if I don't notice they won't say anything. That is dishonesty and not how to do business.",2,ZguM1AgCTqkaUmrASY4Lrg

If you're looking for the wrong way to start your morning, congratulations, this is it! Starbucks is a chain coffee shop where one would expect to find consistency between store to store, but this is not your typical Starbucks. I've been to this location many times over the years, and I can assure you that the only consistency you will find is bad service and disappointment. 

About the bad service: the baristas do not display professionalism in their jobs. While I do not mind an emotionless barista, I hate rude baristas. There have been many situations, but one time, I ordered a macchiato and was given a peppermint flavoured coffee. I told the barista he got my order wrong, and politely asked if I could take the wrong drink to give to my friend (the drink would be tossed out anyway). He decided to snatch the drink out of my hands, slowly pour the drink down the drain while looking me in the eye, then gave a rude ""no"". He can keep his sass; I'm not spending money to pay for his wages anymore. 

About the disappointment: food and drinks are always made sloppily. Take my breakfast sandwich this morning, for example. It was, literally, as hard as a rock. My teeth still hurt from trying to bite into it. Also, my drinks are never near full, and the sides of the cups are always sticky. Thanks for wasting my $5+tax, you sad little Starbucks.

Actual store -- there was something on the edge of the counter that looked like caked-on jam or something (whatever it was was off-putting).  Door from behind the counter (which people were touching), to the kitchen looked greasy from where I was standing.

Now the best.  After waiting and waiting ... and waiting ... I was told ""just wait"" for my latte.  I was so infuriated.  Who is the customer here?  This is one nasty store.  I will never go back.

this store doesn't care about its customers, and my story is a bit on the extreme side. I came here to meet up with a friend for coffee, my friend was running a bit late, but I was able to grab one of the last tables in the store which was great, tapped into the wifi, having a cup of tea, all's good right? next thing I know I have this burning sensation on the back of my calf, what the heck I thought to myself? I look down and all I see is boiling tea water on the ground, steaming from coming in contact with the tiles, it took a lot for me not to scream out in agony, the customer with the tea decided to place his extra hot tea behind his laptop, and then decided to adjust the screen backwards sending the tea flying into the ground and heating up everything in its path. I told you this story which leads me to the customer experience portion, I was asked to vacate my table, they had to clean up all the tea water from my area but not once was I asked if I was ok, even though my shoe print was leaving a trail all around the storefront and I was not walking properly. so the customer gets a free replacement tea and I get nothing, actually I lost my table, because the person who mopped up the area forgot that it was my seat, when I brought up the situation to one of the staff members, I didn't even get an apology, I felt less then human being here, I was hurt by someone else, not acknowledged whatsoever and my table was given up. 
the customer who spilled the tea, when they got the replacement, they decided to put it behind the monitor again.

If you are an occasional coffee drinker like me, you don't need an education on which coffee chain's coffee is better than others. I leave that opinion up to the individual as each of our tastes, preferences and even how we like our coffee are different (cream, milk, sugar, type of roast, style).

I'm sharing this review based on how this Starbucks is better than the hundreds others I've encountered in my travels.

The ordering counter/barista space (sorry - don't know if there is an official word for this area) is pretty standard compared to other locations. There's ample space to create a queue without needing to be so close to the customer in front or behind you if it's busy. Service is pretty standard for Starbucks in that they are keen and friendly when taking your order and spell your name correctly on occasion. I think spelling names incorrectly is their thing. It's generally harmless and seems to give them free publicity through social media as just about everyone has to share their new name.

The dining/lounging space for customers is rather large and combines different seating elements from many other Starbucks together. This is where it gets good. You have your window seats for people watching, your sofas and padded one-seaters with end tables, tables for smaller or larger groups and a decent sized patio on the sidestreet not too close to the road. So much variety depending on what your mood is, who you're with (or not with) and how long you want to stay.

This isn't the Starbucks I frequent because it is not my closest but the times I have stopped here, I would always wish it was at the end of my street. If you're in the area and need a caffeine fix, this is definitely the place, especially if you're a fan of Starbucks.",2,8d3sjUvNdekV0BJfxgjQmw

Generally, this location's speed is ridiculous - they're amazing at being well staffed and everyone moves to get orders done. They're rather efficient, even if the line is about 15 people long, you'll be at the front in less than 10 minutes. And the staff is all very nice and pleasant! And this is currently the only Tim Horton's I know of that's serving grilled paninis (and has been for months!).

My catering order included breakfast and lunch (and the dessert platter) for approximately 20 people; I was able to email my order in to the Manager, who confirmed the cost and pick-up times. Everything was ready to go when i showed up early and they made sure I had everything I needed, plates, knives, napkins, butter, etc. The lunch platters are a total steal and wicked value - they were DEVOURED at the meeting I brought them to and they were totally fresh, nice and cold (pre ordering allows for extra chilling time) and perfect. We've had issues ordering from other places for lunch, with things arriving kind of soggy or not being as fresh and this was NOT the case with Tim Hortons. I'm so pleased with my order, we'll be using them exclusively for meeting like this in the future.

All in, I'm really pleased with the service from this location. The current staff seems to have a good groove at breakfast and lunch rushes and its definitely the most efficient Tim Horton's I've ever been to.",2,vJGLEHyhCs9V-5fAe-xx3w

I've tried about 3 other Starbucks locations in the area but they always left me disappointed and delayed my arrival time to work. The great thing about this Starbucks is that when I order on my phone, they know that there's going to be tons of orders so they designate a person to hand out the online orders. 

Even if I don't order online and order in person, they have a designated person to take peoples orders, enter it into the system beforehand and then once you go to the cashier you wouldn't have to repeat your order. Even though it's really busy, they don't even have to ask for your name. By the time I'm done paying, my drink is already prepared.

They also have about 10 people working during the morning rush and they're all very friendly which is the usual Starbucks.

Since the renovations,  this location is more appealing with updated decor and has plenty of seating area. The design of the lineup for ordering has been streamlined to make it more efficient and has been very effective. 

The best part of this location is being a corner lot because the seating area by the windows is great for people watching at a major intersection if that's your thing.  Definitely makes the coffee/tea breaks and mealtimes experience interesting. 

I'm not a big fan of Timmy's because I'm not much of a coffee person, but occasionally I would order their steeped tea and hot chocolate.   The food is definitely a hit or miss and at times you wonder if it's really food. I rarely order food here except on occasion, I would order their donuts and Timbits.

This afternoon,  I stopped by for some Timbits and was not impressed with the service.   Usually the service is fast and efficient with minimal friendliness depending on how busy it is at the time.  There was only one person ahead of me with two cashiers,  but for some reason it took a while for me to reach the counter.  

I placed my order and said I'll be paying with my mobile app, for some reason the scanner didn't work and I said you can just punch in the number (while handing my phone over).  Instead of entering my card number manually, the cashier left to get help.  When the other person came she realized my Timbits order was not filled and filled it.  Then, another person checked the register and realized that the original cashier didn't touch payment in order to scan my mobile app. How many people does it take to complete a transaction?   Good thing it wasn't busy at that time. 

The person who completed my transaction said to the cashier, ""How long have you been working here? You didn't press payment, you should know this by now.""  The cashier just laughed. I was very patient throughout the mishap and thanked them for my Timbits and that was it,  no thank you for my patience or visit from any of the staff. This was definitely not acceptable of customer service.

Nope. I came slinking shamefully through the door and he just said ""you're back!"" so cheerily I think he was excited to recognise me.

One staff member was busy doing inventory or temperature control of the fridge selection, while three staff members looked like they were making drinks or quite possibly cleaning the machines or containers, that none of them seemed to care that there were two people standing in line waiting to order.  They were so nonchalant that I wondered if they knew they were even working.

I believed I may have waited about 5 minutes (which seemed like an eternity for Starbucks since they're usually quick) before someone came to the cash and I was thinking do I really want my refresher, but I was in need of a cold drink because I was near the end of my run and was extremely thirsty. So, yes I waited patiently to be served and placed my order.

There were many times when I had no issues with the staff members as they're usually friendly and prompt like most Starbucks are known to be, but I gather that they do have off days, but when there were so many staff members when store is not busy, now that's a real concern. 

I'm thinking perhaps with this particular location, they do encounter some sketchy characters from across the street and often times there are panhandlers or drunks by the entrance, so not sure how often do they venture inside the store and what kind of impact they have on the staff.

The aftermath of Mcdonalds is better than the way this employee treats customers. My female friend did not know what she wanted when we got to the front of the line, so the barista Dan rudely told us ""Go to the side because I have other customers that I need to serve"". When a female barista came to help us, there was a misunderstanding with my friend about the ""starbucks points"", which the female barista was kindly trying to explain to her. After a while my male friend asked if he can pay for the drink because the conversation was taking a while which the female barista kindly said ""no, let me explain"". Eventually we were getting aggravated, as were other customers in line, because the conversation was dragging on and the three of us got the point of how ""starpoints"" work. Of course the barista Dan comes in and says ""You are being destructive. You need to either order or get out of the store"", which upset one of my male friends whom told him ""Don't talk to her that way, we ordered, we have been trying to pay for our drink for five minutes"". Of course this male barista proceeds to get rude and says ""well if you want to make a complaint GO AHEAD ILL GIVE YOU MY MANAGERS CARD and you can complain"" which made us question the managing of the place as well, and continued to say that when my male friend said ""Listen, we just want our drink, so either give us the drink that we paid for or give us our money back because you're being really rude and threatening to kick us out when we've asked to pay for the drink repeatedly and we did. Our friend wanted to know about the starpoints which she was confused. So give me my money back if thats how you are going to treat my friend"". 

DAN was very RUDE. and very UNPLEASANT.

To top things off, he stated ""I have got one of my coworkers to call the police on you three if you dont get out of this shop"" which we left because we believed this UNNECESSARY situation that your EMPLOYEE caused FOR YOUR PAYING CUSTOMERS was getting out of hand. 

I have told my friends about the incident who are regular customers, and they do not ever plan on coming back to this location. I am disgusted. I question the management at this location based on the way your employee had treated us as customers.

If your employees did not call the police, in which they had NO reason to to begin with because it was over my friend being confused about the starbucks points, I would have left the situation alone and not come back.

Anyway, June 11, 2018 will be etched in my mind for a while. First, I was downtown to see Depeche Mode in concert. Second, this date is significant if you are a regular Starbucks customer. All Starbucks locations in the GTA were shut down for several hours for racial bias training.

My original plan was to grab a drink at my usual Starbucks location by my workplace before heading downtown. I recall seeing a sign a few days earlier saying that the store was closed on Monday. That's okay. Sure, I am a regular customer. However, skipping it for a day won't kill me.

I got downtown and was thirsty. I saw that this Starbucks was open. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. I walked in and got a grande iced black tea.

This location is clean and cheerful. My barista was friendly. I got my drink fast and walked out drinking it. It tasted great.

Not only do you get a nice, hot beverage, you get it with a shot of extra strength customer service and a healthy sprinkle of efficiency. Starbucks may be a corporate overlord, but this particular branch looks after the people. 

Catering to the morning rush, this particular Starbucks in the York Concourse should definitely be considered the gold standard. Mobile orders are prepared by a dedicated team so there is no bottleneck. Even when buying in-store, there is a designated order-taking person in the queue so that by the time you're at the counter, they've got your order and all you have to do is pay. 

Most importantly, they're designated as a Starbucks Express which means, NO FRAPPUCCINOS. No 20 item customization, extra sugar, extra cream abomination. No unicorns or crystal balls. They serve everything else on the menu so it's not a big loss in my opinion. If anything, it allows things to move very smoothly which is exactly what commuters want. Get in, get out. If that bothers you, there are many other Starbucks just outside on Front St. 

Plus, the people are so nice. Yeah, most people at Starbucks are pretty nice, but these guys are extra nice. Every one of them says good morning and asks you how your day is going. I've had nice chats and gotten recommendations from them (very berry hibiscus made with coconut milk instead of water, thanks Rhys). 

Once, I was an idiot and tried to pour milk while the top clearly wasn't screwed in and it fell straight into my drink. The girl refilling lids there immediately said she'll get me another one, and she did. This place has to be the ""how to run a Starbucks"" poster child.

Since there seems to be no separation between the lower and upper level Tim Hortons, this review will be for the upper level Tim Hortons.

The upper level Tim Hortons is quite busy, and in my opinion too small for the demand it serves. I probably should've went to the lower level Tim Hortons, but I had an errand to run where I had to meet someone in the upper level Timmies.

This Tim Hortons was staffed quite well on a weekday at around 5pm, as I didn't have a long lineup. I ordered an iced capp, which is usually what I order in Tim Hortons nowadays. The drink was okay, something that was satisfying enough while I waited for my client.

What made me took away a star for this Tim Hortons is its general sketchiness. The upper level Tim Hortons attracts some homeless folks from outside, as they occasionally roam inside and interrogate the customers inside. I had that happen twice in the hour or so I was there. Eventually security was called the second time around and the homeless person was escorted out of the Tim Hortons.

Regardless, I'll likely stick with the lower level Tim Hortons next time around. Why are there two Tim Hortons locations inside College Park anyway...?",0,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA

It was one of those days and I cho-cho-chose this location on Parliament and Dundas. 

Free wi-fi, nice indoor seating, and a cup of coffee and some good breakfast lured me in. I was hoping it'd be quieter but it was super busy. I got lucky and found seating - a 2 seater. I looked around for outlets - none to be found - which was quite disappointing, because I was hoping to work from Timmies for a few hours. And when you do the kind of work I do, laptop charge usually won't last for more than an hour. So, sadly, I had to finish up my breakfast and leave within the hour. 

Did I have a normal hour? No. Be prepared for hobos to walk in and try to find seating. The employees are usually too busy to notice. A hobo came up to me and asked me if he could sit across from me.

I ended up staying at this Starbucks at the NE corner of Queen and Bathurst for a few hours on a Sunday night. It wasn't rammed like every other open coffeeshop, and stayed open until 10:00pm. A supervisor/manager was even checking up on lingering patrons, and offered me a free refill of brewed coffee.  Other than that, typical Starbucks rules apply.

Obligatory Title Pun: BUCKing the trend.

Menu Readability: Like McDonalds: if you don't know what they serve, get the Hell out of line.

Need to mention: I think you need a key for this washroom. It's kind of a sketchy corner.

Some real highs and lows here.

Highs:  Very nice, helpful and friendly staff, good coffee, good Timbits.  All a real plus for me, especially the service being so great, which is hard to find in Toronto.

Lows:  Every table needed wiping.  My loyal Yelp followers (all 3 of them) will know that forgetting to wash tables just because customers try to clean up after themselves in a fast food joint is a major pet peeve for me.  Maybe we should carry a wet cloth with us so staff doesn't have to do that part?  AND the floor was incredibly dirty, littered with dropped napkins and other debris, knee deep.  AND the counter where the napkins are kept (not the service counter) was dirty, and all 3 napkin holders had zero napkins.  I had Timbit glaze on my hands (well, I will admit to being totally glazed), and did not want to pick up all my shopping bags and return to the service counter for a napkin.  I must stress that the store was not busy at all, there were no lineups all the time I was there (about half an hour).

This location understands that people are busy and have places to be.

Coffee is always served with a smile!  And they've only messed up my coffee once this year, not bad!

There is a Starbucks across the street...and I do prefer Starbucks coffee.

Shorter wait time wins!  
Croissant with half the calories wins!

I tried fulfilling a timbit craving at a less busy shop and I learned my lesson.  Not only were they out of the timbits I wanted (honey cruller); the flavours that were available and that I purchased were dry, hard, extra sweet, and gross.

Well, I decided the next time I had a timbit craving I would head to College Park since this place is always busy.  

I was not disappointed!!!  Ordered 5 honey cruller and 5 honey dip.  They were amazing!!!!  The honey crullers melted in my mouth - they were so fresh, soft, and yummy.  The honey dips were pretty good too but not quite as good as the honey crullers.  I inhaled them within 10 minutes - 1 minute/ timbit.

It doesn't resemble the typical starbucks layout, its looks like a long narrow hallway, its taken on an industrial concept with concrete floors and walls, high ceilings, a long banquet in the back across from the cash, more seating in the front with couches and a large table for group studying, plus a fireplace!

Fall time at Starbucks is my favourite time of year. 

My Fall Favouirtes here include:

Pumpkin Spice Latte - Espresso, pumpkin-flavored syrup and steamed milk sprinkled with a dash of pumpkin pie spices
It's a must have fall beverage!

Pumpkin Loaf - A moist, spicy quick bread made with ripe pumpkin and a blend of fall spices. 
I love that it has rasins and walnuts in the loaf and its coated with pumpkin seeds on the outside for extra crunch. It's a thick dense loaf but super yummy, great for breakfast!

Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin - Pumpkin muffin with crunchy, candied pumpkin seeds and cream cheese filling.
This is the ultimate muffin, its contains all your foods groups veg=pumpkin, dairy=luscious sweet and tangy cream cream cheese, protein=crunchy candied pumpkin seeds, carb=moist pumpkin spice infused batter. My favourite muffin!

Pumpkin Scone - A pumpkin spiced scone dipped in white icing, accented with pumpkin icing. 
This scone is melt in your mouth delicious! It's a large scone, it reminds me almost of gingerbread but softer and flufflier, the scone itself is not too sweet but with the glaze it balances it out perfectly!

I like that this is a tad thicker versus typical juices. Halfway to smoothie but thin enough to still be called juice. Despite the inclusion of celery and parsley, the flavour isn't overpowered by these two ingredients. Lemme tell ya - I am NOT a fan of celery (blehh!) but drinking green juices often has somewhat neutralized my tastebuds to this flavour. Almost can't taste it in Evolution's Sweet Green!

And I'm not just talking about the drinks.

This is less of a review and more of a story. A day before I visited this Starbucks, located steps away from the Gardiner at the corner of Kipling and Evans, I received an email that changed everything. Someone I hadn't spoken to for months wanted to see me again, and we quickly made plans for a date at this Starbucks, which was just a few minutes from her house.

Despite my initial hesitance to journey out there with no expectations, I found myself extremely impressed with the site and the staff's attention to detail. This was late afternoon on a Friday, and the staff chatted with me when I walked in ahead of schedule and was trying to figure out what to order. One of the employees had some great recommendations and took their time explaining aspects to me, which I was surprised by considering that the place wasn't even that busy.

I sat down and took a look around the place. Despite the location, this feels like a little oasis in the midst of an otherwise-industrial area. (Fun fact: the office complex across the street once housed Michael Ignatieff's campaign office, which I covered when it opened way back in 2010.) Despite the usual kind of crowd (teens on computers and older couples), it was extremely quiet, and I could sit and look out at the snow falling on the street. The venue itself is a bit tough to get into parking-wise, but this has the benefit of limiting speeding cars, which makes a huge difference.

Due to miscommunication issues with my date, I almost left, but lo and behold, she was somehow able to call the store directly and get them to tell me to wait for her. Unbelievable customer service, above and beyond what I expected. I ended up ordering a latte for her when she arrived, and we spent the next three hours catching up. 

Definitely a memorable experience, helped by the fantastic staff. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this place exceeded my expectations tenfold.

I used to take my re-useable mug, but no more.  They have to shift to recyclable materials.  They still use ALOT of plastic and this is killing our environment at the manufacturing level.  Also, wouldn't most Canadians pay a little more for their coffee so it could be served in a recyclable cup (apparently a costlier alternative to the ones they use now)?  Yes, the consumers play a huge role.  If consumers keep buying (and disgarding) the non-green harmful stuff, Tim Hortons, no longer a Canadian institution, will continue making it.

I asked for one of those, and was given the option of regular or barbecue, and I had to stammer for a second and say regular. Don't offer me something that isn't on the menu!

Anyway, it was ready shockingly fast and I soon discovered why. This was one hastily assembled concoction. It was pretty much oozing ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard, to the point where those condiments were literally all I could taste. The super soft bread didn't really help matters, as it, when combined with the less-than-robust patty, ensured that the burger was absolutely devoid of any texture aside from mushiness.

I got an hours worth of work done and watched the barista on cash do an incredible job of greeting customers, moving the line along, saying hello to regulars and new faces alike. 

When a customer wanted things that were out of stock, she was quick to recommend an alternative. A customer came in to get change for parking on the Danforth but unfortunately they couldn't open the til. But they were able to find a solution by doing the order now and putting it on hold until the customer came back.

Bathroom needs a code. 

Definitely narrow lines and hard to get to the back of the line during peak time, but nothing you can really do about that.

If so, this Tim's definiely counts. Set just steps away from St. George Station, this is the prime site for students at U of T to congregate - and it has can certainly boast its status as the busiest Tim's in the local area, if not the entire city.

You haven't seen lineups until you visit this place. I went here last week for a meetup for a Kijiji sale, and decided to take my time and send out some emails as I waited. 20 minutes and a whole lot of confusion later, I managed to grab a single stool at the end of the long table facing the window and sat, sipping my XL dark roast and tapping away as a girl who still had spots on her face hovered a foot away from me trying to find a spot to stand as people kept packing into the place.

Make no mistake, this is not the place to come if you expect prompt service. One other review referred to this place as a ""gong show"", and he hit the mark. The servers are trying their best, but you have people constantly coming in who have no idea what they want until they get up to the counter, slowing everyone down behind them. People take up tables and don't use them, wasting valuable space so they can chomp on a donut and sit for two hours whittling away with their friends. The place is extremely cluttered, both from a trash and design standpoint, and if this place was renovated at any point in the last two years, I certainly don't see it.

In the end, this Tim's is nothing more than a stopover if you need something quick to eat. Don't make this a destination for food, and definitely DON'T stop here between 12 - 2 p.m. if you don't want to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the post-secondary crowd.

There are two Tims nearby if you look up Tims location.

Although I gotta give them credit for setting up an express line for beverages and bakery items.  The express line is usually ok during rush hour.

For tourist, this is located inside a food court which offers many other restaurants and you do have a lot of clean, modern seating in the food court.  But you will have trouble finding seats at lunch during week days.

Quality is on par with other Tims, service is great here.  Some cashiers actually remember customers' names, you only expect that from Starbucks. I have only experienced good and happy cashiers so far.  Great job.

I feel like they can do more to speed up the line during rush hour, maybe install one additional cashier machine for beverage to make the express line even faster.  I hate it when the line is too long that I have to go to Starbucks in the same food court.",0,56_DKQpK4tT0rWLt4-DZOQ

First, the staff is completely incompetent.  This has been a growing theme amongst Starbucks', but they do some things that really irritate me.

The staff touch their eyes, lips, face, hair and never wash their hands.  Today the girl behind the counter was picking gunk off her eyelash - didn't wash her hands.  They've had two staff members with visible lip cold sores (i.e. herpes) serving ... just, like, the peeps a day off.  

The staff has major attitude as well.  I have a really weird drink order. I get it. I announce that it's weird before I launch into it.  But it's also a $6 drink.  So, for $6, I think I can ask for my drink in an odd way.  It's nothing they can't do.  But today the dude literally rolled his eyes, laughed at me, and went over to discuss it with his co-worker. WTF. What the acutal eff.

Anyway, it's the closest Starbucks to my work so when it's -20, I have little to no choice if I want something from a Sbux.  But I hate it nonetheless.  Actually now I'm just realizing maybe it only serves people in the Hilton (i.e. tourists) because most other offices have a closer Starbucks, so they don't care how they treat people because they don't think they get a lot of repeat business.

- Too much chatter and idle conversation between the staff members especially during long line up times, distracting them for being productive and focused.

She then precedes to argue with me about what I ordered, attempts to bring the cashier in to it (the cashier pulls away and disappears, clearly realizing the inappropriateness), and eventually makes my hot chocolate, slamming it down on the counter without looking at me.

MAYBE an isolated incident, but still, completely inexcusable.

This is my second time at this location and the warming up of the sandwiches takes SO long. It's weird.. is there an engine that needs to warm up before it heats up a sand which? I don't get why it would take 12-15 minutes. 

My regular order: 

1 iced coffee with milk and caramel syrup - this has a strong taste but the caramel makes it a tad sweeter. 
1 light Mocha Coconut Frappucino -without whip cream - delicious and the coconut sprinkles on the top really give it a kick against the regular mocha drinks 
spinach and egg white wrap - fantastic veggie healthy snack. The wrap is multi grain and toasted. 
tuna or roasted pepper chicken panini - yumm. It's usually placed right at the front so you grab what looks good and they will warm it up for you.

It's very small and crammed, and extremely busy during office hours. The staff are not the most friendly of the Starbucks I visit, and seem to run out of certain coffees a lot. There is very limited seating and they seem to close early every night. I walk by there on my way to Goodlife around 8:45 and they're locked up. This location boasts a 9pm close time so for it to be locked and lights off at 8:45 is unacceptable.

The Good:

1. Location. It's in a fairly quiet area so on the off hours the location won't be packed.

The Bad:

1. Size. It's too small for a Starbucks.
2. Queue. The lines can be long.
3. Hours. Closes early!

Recommendation: go to the Starbucks at Ted Rogers Way/Bloor. It's close and much, much better!",1,jki5LnYkm9Zb2x4bCBrHQA

This Starbucks location has the friendliest staff I have encountered of any Starbucks. This could be that they know my face, and I am somehow given the 'regulars' treatment. I hope not, because I don't know anyone here. I barely make any eye contact with the people I recognize from my Church buying coffee here. This location caters mainly to the residents of Deer Park. 
On Sunday mornings, if I manage to get a seat by the window, I would stare out into the streets and watch the unending black yoga pants and neon coloured shirt locals jog down Yonge Street, breathing in all that car exhaust. 

There are almost always one or two panhandlers directly outside, or closer to the Tim Horton's directly next door. There is a small area to secure your dog's leash out front while you buy your coffee. 
Coffee here tastes much like coffee anywhere.

The cleanliness here varies from pretty clean, to not very clean. I would like it if they'd clean it more often. It's very boring, not much can be said. 
One thing good about this place is that you won't find beanie wearing people who live off of free WIFI, considering its Deer Park, and everyone here can afford such things on their own.

The first, an iced Gingerbread Tea Latte - the person taking the order could not figure out how to make it iced OR ring it up until we gave them some tips. The third drink, an iced decaf eggnog frapp, was not blended (simply served over ice) and not decaf. They also put whipped cream on every drink despite our request otherwise. They also had trouble with the sizes (""Large, please."" ""Grande?"" ""No, Venti."" ""So, medium?"").

Let's begin.

This store is located in the Bloor Islington Place building. That means that around 9am you'll see long lines of business attire clad office workers lining up for their daily caffeine fix. It also means that by 6:30 pm they have closed their doors as they literally do cater to the office crowd. I will admit, most of the workers are friendly.

My beef though, is with the fact this location is constantly missing standard ingredients. Their Italian Deli Sandwich often won't have that awesome parmesan crusted bread its supposed to come in (and really, the only reason I want to eat that thing). Common found bagel varieties are simply not on offer. And my real deal-breaker, is not offering Egg Whites on breakfast sandwiches. Offering egg-whites instead of their mediocre flavoured egg patty thing is at least a good and healthy option that every other location of Tim Hortons has offered. It is an ever so small but beneficial perk that Tim Hortons breakfast offers that makes it tolerable in the grand scheme of fast food breakfast options. This location apparently does not offer this, which is really the main reason for me to even fathom a Tim Hortons review. So take that into consideration if looking to have your breakfast needs met here.",0,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g

This was my second time here in two days and I was hoping they could redeem themselves. Service was awful, Archana was not focused when taking our order and made the wrong drinks.

Being a grad student, I usually stumble onto campus around 11am and leave about 10-12 hours later, and I get great reliable service at this location. However, this location has proven to have awful early-morning service, which I find especially unforgivable in a coffee shop.

If people are going to expect fast efficient friendly service at any time in particular, it will be in the morning, in a coffee shop.

Each time I've arrived at 8:30am, this store either has too few baristas, and/or the baristas that are on staff move at a snail's pace. Nobody wants to see a lineup of 10 people with one barista standing there with her hand on her hip, and the other struggling to find the buttons on the cash register at 8 in the morning.

I've also arrived when they were training newbies on the register. Why train staff at 8am? Train them at 8pm, when no one is in a rush.

One barista didn't rinse my mug, and had to dump out the coffee and try again.

They have a nice seating arrangement next to their coffee bar- warm colored, cozy, spacious, and they have a few arm chairs.

My parents, however, deprived me and my sister of Tim Hortons. Now as an adult I recognized that I must right this wrong! Therefore, I made it a point to go to Tim Hortons on my recent business trip to Toronto. 

Tim Hortons was conveniently in the same RBC building where my work office was located, but the food court area on the 2nd floor was jam packed during the lunch hours. I was in between a 30 min break and had to choose my lunch wisely. Luckily Tim Hortons' line was not only the shortest but also the quickest. I was in and out of Tim Horton's in 7 min tops. 

While I was waiting in line to deliberate on what to get, I knew instantly that I had to get the waffle, sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. It was love at first sight. I've been on a McDonald's McGriddle kick lately, so it was only fitting to get this breakfast sandwich from Tim Hortons. As I suspected this sandwich was good. In fact it was so good that I found it better than a McGriddle. The sausage, egg, and cheese were comparable to the ones on a McGriddle, but the waffle bun was the differentiating factor that put Tim Hortons' sandwich a step above. The waffle had sugar granules sprinkled on top and balanced the overall proportions of savory vs sweetness very well. I loved it and would highly recommend this sandwich to anyone. Furthermore, the good news is that Tim Hortons serves breakfast all day.

I enjoyed the potato wedges. Sure, there wasn't anything particularly unique about them. The seasoning and texture of the potato wedges made me a fan of them though!

Obviously Tim Hortons is known for its donuts. I knew I wasn't going to have an appetite for a few whole donuts, so I opted to get the Timbits instead. The Timbits were donut holes, and you could choose to get them as assorted or one flavor. I got the assorted in order to sample multiple flavors. The Timbits flavors for today included the chocolate, plain glazed, and raspberry filled powdered sugar. The chocolate timbit was by far the tastiest of all 3.",2,wzwyPHDR6bwf_iiQuDl0aw

Ever since I broke my leg five weeks ago, friends have been dropping by to visit me and we come down to this nearby Starbucks for a cup of Joe and some conversation. Please note, this Starbucks is always packed. 

Their front patio is a clear example of architectural minimalism, rarely do I see the 'concrete slab look' captured so well. Some tables stand guard in front, waiting to serve customers who are lucky to get one or those who come knocking during thunderstorms.  

Their interior is standard cookie-cutter Starbucks decor and the staff seems friendly enough. Nothing new. They do however have free Wifi and as such the place is surrounded  by leeches with iphones, ipads and laptops, some of them are even nice enough to buy their way with cup of coffee. 

If you are already a Starbucks fan, then me saying their overpriced black swig tastes more like burnt oil than actually beans will surely not deter you from purchasing their product.
 
You see, I will be the first to admit I am no coffee connoisseur but having tasted standard, run of the mill coffee from hole-in-wall cafés in France and Italy AND Turkish and Ethiopian coffee from right here in Toronto, I do not understand why people pay a premium for this stuff. Perhaps their excellent marketing or their store location scouts?

Also I will be the first one to admit that flavour can be a highly subjective thing. However, I do not think most people come here because they love Starbucks, they mostly come here because aside a slightly overpriced Fionn MacCool's, there is no patio to seat or place to hangout in a two block radius.

It is not uncommon to  see some ""famous"" hotel goers come here for a drink. For example the Real Madrid players came to get a coffee here when staying during their game in Toronto. Additionally, this location is next to a few offices, and the Shangri-la hotel as well, making it convenient to go for coffee on a break. Lastly, many of those who access the path from the west side of the city can stop here for a coffee, in fact this is the further north west PATH location which can be reached. 

5/5 Coffee is quite consistent, and tastes as good as the best starbucks locations.Never burnt. Both drip coffee and the specialty drinks are good.

5/5 Service generally good, fast and efficient. The line up can be out the door, but this is due to the sheer volume of patrons.

Up a very long staircase you will find at the top a beautiful long modern space with lots of tables and even some comfy chairs to offer refuge from the winter wind. 

Overall my server was super nice and remembered to ask if I wanted whipped cream on my cherry mocha which does not always happen and I end up with that fatty glob on top. The limited edition mocha was quite lovely but next time I will go for dark chocolate to make it more sophisticated.

Please note the staircase is quite a climb so those with mobility issues will have to make space for themselves in the small area at the back.

Overall the location is great, the service was excellent, the decor attractive and there is tons of space upstairs. I would definitely go back.

It's got an exceptional location at the corner of Broadview and Danforth, although the layout of it is terrible. Since it's long and narrow, the entire kitchen and prep area is here, causing employees constant unnecessary walking back and forth. 

There's no seating in here, it's just grab and go - but more like wait 5 mins, order, wait even more, and then leave. Long line ups form in the morning, one at each cash register, but they need to establish some sort of single line format to manage this. Needs ropes and things as people walk in, otherwise so much wasted space and lots of confusion.

But WHY is there a line in the first place? Tims are supposed to be fast - order and basically before you finish talking the coffee should be in your hands, but after still 2 months - they still haven't figure it out yet. Every Saturday morning, I wait at least 5-10 mins for my coffee because they are just slow. 

They gave the Coffee Time up on the corner a run for their money, but since it's got seating there, local elderly folk seem to gather there. Coffee tastes about the same. 
There's also Si Espresso across the west side of broadview if you want to support the local indie coffee house. McD's also has quite a good coffee and they are much faster in service.

Being in a hospital, this location gets millions of dollars in business. Unfortunately, this comes with lines that are often long and move at a snail's pace. They do not have the right combination of physical space and staff to prepare specialty drinks, so things really slow down if there have been 4-5 specialty drink orders in a row.

Slightly more problematic than the pace of the line is the preparation of the drinks. I have had my order completely forgotten and another completely wrong in recent visits.

I walked into my friendly neighborhood Timmy's this morning and was confronted with a doughy confectionary beast the likes of which these fine eyes have never seen, and are unlikely to see again: the Dirt with Worms doughnut.

Part glazed doughnut, part chocolate-based orgasm, part earthworm, part grade school art project, this is a truly inspired baking achievement, undoubtedly the magnum opus of whomever conceived of it. Frankly, this writer is of the opinion that they should just retire, because it's all downhill from here. The first bite introduces the consumer's mouth to a world of doughnut, crumbled Oreo, and chocolate frosting, a combination of taste as old as sugar comas themselves.

But the real treat comes with the first taste of gummy worm. Artfully laid in such a manner as to suggest emerging from the doughnut hole (which, along with the rest of the doughnut, is colored brown with cookie bits, making it look like the actual ground, like where earthworms actually live, which I find clever, despite having the subtlety of a sledgehammer - but I digress), this miracle of breakfast pastry is matched in taste only by artistic tastefulness. The extra dimension provided by these worms truly pushes this creation over the edge.

This writer has tasted a world of doughnuts, from Tims to Dunkin to Tims and back to Dunkin, but he has never found one quite as unique, quite as varied, quite as, well, magical as Dirt with Worms. Despite its effectively punching my ticket on the Heart Disease Express, this is a one of a kind experience that could not be recommended highly enough.",1,B11ZAS1UF0RpLWgSPJ4Hvw

Anyway, this Tim Hortons serves coffee and breakfast food items (bagels, croissants, sandwiches with egg, cheese, bacon, or sausage).  

They seem to have a language for ordering coffee that I have not been taught.  Apparently, a ""double-double"" (which to us Californians means a cheeseburger from In-N-Out with two patties) means two cream, two sugar.  A ""triple-triple"" is three cream, three sugar, etc.  If you said ""triple-triple"" in California, they would laugh at you and tell you that the correct phrase is ""3 by 3"".

However, they've been severely lacking in performance over the last few months. I understand that being jam-packed is mainly out of their control, but I dislike when they mess up my order and have me waiting. I ordered using a promo code but it wouldn't go through. So I cancelled it and ordered a breakfast wrap but another barista informed him that it didn't work because I needed to order a grande to get the promo - could you not have told him that before? They forgot to make my wrap and so I asked them 5 minutes later how much longer it would be. They said they just sold the last spinach-feta wrap. Ugh.

I came a few other times without incident, but there was another day where it wasn't busy at all. The barista was wrapping up what she was doing at the cash register and I waited. When she was ready she asked me what I'd like. She misheard me and I repeated what I wanted. I wanted the frappe and instead I got a latte.

After the post security of the B and C gates of Terminal 3 and just to the left there's a Timmy's that seems to be more organized than the Tim's in Terminal 1.  I admin I rarely go to Terminal 3 as opposed to 1 so I can't ever say I remember coming to this particular Tim's before.  The one thing you'll notice that it's quite busy with 3 separate lines going but no lines in particular for just beverages so all three are full service (food and all).

The pickups seem to all take place at the right side and that area can get a bit uncomfortably packed if many are waiting for their orders.  They're calling our orders by number for pickup so try to remember your number or check your receipt for the last 2 digits.

As always I'm no fan of Tim's breakfast sandwiches.  Everything just tastes reheated and doesn't seem as fresh as A&W or McD's for quick breakfasts.  Their coffee is ok.

They don't seem to have their own seating so if you head down to where the other places are (the area that looks like a food court) there may be seating there.

But I do have a grievance that I need to voice.  
I have placed the Starbucks located at Yonge and King on my BlackList reserved for establishments that I will no longer Frequent.

2 years ago while waiting at the bar to pick up my latte,  I noticed a robust Cockroach running behind the Espresso Machine.  Now, your saying, ""well that was 2 years ago"", yes, but anyone who know anything about Cockroaches (or any type of household critter) knows that once you see one Roach, you probably have millions living in the shadows.  Fact: ""Roaches are one of the most resilient critters ever"" and although pesticides can kill many, its hard to get all of them.  With that in mind, I decided for sanitary reasons to avoid this location all together.
If you are a Starbucks employee (or worked there 2 years ago) then you must know that you have ""Cockroach Problem"".  

Like I said before, I really like Starbucks, but I hate Roaches more than anything. (Im sure the reasons are obvious).  Although the presence of a Roach near my coffee didn't affect the quality of my drink,  I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth so to speak.

I will continue to be a Starbucks patron, just not at this location.  For all those King Streeters who rely on this shop for your morning caffeine fix sorry if this alarms you.

There are 2 Timmy's in T1 at Pearson that I know of.  One is in the F gates (US gates) near gate F66.  This listing I'm assuming is for the domestic gates (D gates).  This location is just past security on the left side.  

This particular Timmy's is really busy.  It's the first place most people see upon passing security and while there are plenty of restaurants in this part of Pearson, Timmy's is just very popular for breakfast in the morning and coffee.  

This is also a good place to get a bottled water at a reasonable price considering other vendors post security will gouge you for drinks because you're not allowed to go through security with any liquid exceeding 100ml (3 fl oz).  

I'm not big on Timmy's hot breakfast.  Honestly if you want a real sit down breakfast at a decent price you can have a nice sit down breakfast at A&W near the end of D gates for under 10 bucks.

Timmy's is cheap, and it tastes cheap.  The best item for breakfast is probably the bagels.  The biscuits seem dry, not fluffy and flat.  The eggs they put on the biscuits just seem so pre-made.  

During am hours there's a seperate line just for beverages on the right (630 to 10am I think).

The doughnuts are not as good as they used to be.  Overall I think the quality of Timmy's has gone down.  My favorite doughnuts are French crullers and they seem to run out of those.  I think those are the only fried ones.",2,65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw

A couple of things that should be noted are that due to location, this is no doubt a busier store, and it is open 24 hours a day. Unfortunately, I can't accept those things as reasons for why this location falls short of expectations.

First and biggest problem with this store is their cleanliness and upkeep. Every time I have ever been in there, the place is a mess. The condiment stand is filthy, no lids or napkins, milk carafes are empty, their food case is half empty and looks like a tornado passed through, no paper towels or toilet paper in the washrooms. That kind of thing.

My second issue would be with their beverage quality. I understand I may have had bad luck and had new baristas making my drinks and the like, but the drinks I've had from the location have been embarrassingly bad and riddled with rookie mistakes. Some examples: no whipped cream on my hot chocolate even though hot chocolates always get whipped cream unless you say you don't want any (the barista making it didn't even ask), ordering an unsweetened soy green tea latte and getting a cup with well over an inch of room from the rim (if I'm paying 60 cents extra for soy, my cup definitely shouldn't look like that), etc. I'm not the type to complain about things like these ever, especially not in a store to an employee's face, and I never have, but when it comes to drinks, some of these baristas really need to up their game. Maybe their A-team works mornings only.

One more odd thing: I was there a couple days ago later at night (11PM-midnight) and tried to get a Clover-brewed coffee, but was told I couldn't because their Clover was off for the night. That's normal for stores to shut down their Clover at night before closing, but I can't understand why this store shuts off their Clover if they are open 24/7, especially when a Clover coffee makes them so much more money per cup. A mystery.

The one saving grace is that the service is always great and the people working here are always super nice and friendly. Unfortunately, this location falls short in too many other categories and I will really only come here late at night because it's the only option around. Otherwise, I will gladly go to another Starbucks and not this one. Sorry!",4,mWZjSCki8--OQ4FzuXd3nw

One of the tiniest Timmies I've been to and generally I don't like tiny Tims or ones in food courts as they tend to be extra slow in service and order mix up is a norm; but not this one.

The lineup here is MADDENING - but the wait time is comparatively short and, orders are made properly and correctly. The switch they made in how the line up is handled - having multiple cash registers open -was quite effective in achieving this effectiveness PLUS allowing some room for passerbys to squeeze through(although that didn't last, cuz more people seem to have heard of this gap and shortened line and appeared to help it lengthen). The morning rush is insane - but the cashiers in general are friendly and accurate. The order -getters are nice and are happy to make last adjustments to how ur order is made. This seems so trivial but I realize how much I appreciate this little gesture of changing my order from a DD to a regular with milk AFTER making the drink  and without signs of irritation - adds to the good vibrations:D

- their cream/milk bar was out of both, until I brought it to their attention and literally passed over the containers, they filled the containers and then passed them back to me, so that I could put them back (does someone owe me a tip?)

There's no other good coffee alternative this close to my school lab (as I always prefer to go the independent route but alas) and with the registered Starbucks card I get my organic soy milk for free instead of the regular 60 cents, which  is obviously robbery but what do i expect?

Plus, sometimes when it's late and I don't need a full coffee, I just ask for a sample of their regular brew and receive a nice shot size of caffeine, which is all it takes to keep me going sometimes.

Not enough gluten-free options though, and that goes for any Starbucks. They have been selling those gluten-free nut bars, but my intake of nuts has to be low, so it's not an ideal situation. Many places carry gluten-free brownies and muffins, what about you Starbucks?",0,oGzoCwxBRB7OjuX5UeOnQQ

This Starbucks is nice because it's large and has a lot of available seating which is always empty since most finance peeps just grab and go. I'd say it's an excellent spot for a quick meeting. 
The people here are not nice and I sure as hell know they were talking shit behind my back after I left. I wanted to grab a quick passion tea and a lemon raspberry loaf. Already had a very rough day and thought the lemon loaf would help. When asked to warm it up, he said no, because it CAN'T be warmed. Excuse me???? I worked at sbux too and must've warmed around 200 of those. I understand some items with icing are advised not to be warmed due to burnt tongues and mouths of dumb people. However this is not one of them as the icing is minimal and sbux can technically warm up anything; it's a matter of whether they want to or not. He handed me the brick of loaf and trust... I know how these frozen ass pastries come... if not warmed, I will not consume..ever. I told him that I don't want it if it can't be warmed because the sbux down the street on university ave. will warm it for me. He rolled his eyes and so did the other people working there and said ""fine we can warm it"" 
There was a lot of attitude and hostility in the entire transaction & honestly ruined my afternoon. 

Then the passion tea came and idk why trained these staff but don't you know to scoop off the foam from shaking the tea so my $3 iced tea doesn't consume of 30% foam and 50% ice????

If anything, the service I received today is deserving of zero stars. First off, I go to Starbucks all the time but this one was by far the worst experience of them all and usually starbucks employees are always pleasant When i made my order the lady had no smile but rather a b*tch face on her and a mean attitude... i felt as if she was being rscist (im asian by the way) I told her my order and she wasn't even listening (i asked for caramel macchiato less foam  on decaf and lactose-free milk) never even asked for my name but there was a line up behind me. How do they even know what my order is. Also she got my order completely wrong. Like I said, I ordered a caramel macchiato decaf lactose free. My husband also ordered his latte. When both orders came out they were wrong and I told the lady nicely ... and by the way I even said ""I'm so sorry but you got my order wrong and if it's ok to change it to my requested order."" The girl who made my order at the counter also had a b*tch face and had the audacity to get pissed off... she threw the milk into the sink with an attitude and banged everything into the sink as if she was pissed off at me for getting my order wrong. I don't normally write this type of review but this one had to be heard. I most likely will never ever come back to the Starbucks ever again I really think the people at the counter are either racist or pissed off at their boss, ... who knows. Or maybe they could just be having a bad day but if you're working in this type of Industry you shouldn't be taking it out on your customers. This must be a management issue and management needs to correct this otherwise they'll have more bad reviews like this one. The service industry should not be taking it out on their customers. Management should be talking to their employees to correct this behaviour.

Foursquare asked me when I checked in, if this was suitable for a date, and no. However, this was in the middle of December. In the summer I imagine a very large patio space, and your only real option of a decent cafe in this area with such a thing, unless you head over to Bayview.

It was so sad! So I got on the plane to Toronto, and there's no food because it's a short flight. So I had some peanuts and some cookies... But I was ridiculously hungry and ridiculously tired when I finally got through customs, when suddenly I spied this Tim Hortons and it was the greatest thing I've ever seen at that time. :-)

It's been so long since I've had Tim Hortons, I didn't even know they had actual food now! So I asked for the chili, and they were already sold out, and I told the server my sad story of losing my dinner in Minneapolis, & she told me the soup was even better than the chili! And then she gave me a soup filled all the way to the brim (more than I could eat!), and also a huge wheat roll, which maybe they always do, but I don't know, it's not in the picture on the menu. :-) Anyway, wonderful place and wonderful location!",0,9re_Lp17bns7i9_43z01cA

I have no idea how good it was before, but I can confirm Wikipedia's statement. Yep, it kinda sucked. Jamie W. and I came here because we got thirsty, and childhood memories gravitated him to this spot.

After all, we were feeling the oppressive heat wave Toronto was experiencing earlier this month. We were walking down from Casa Loma when the urge occurred, and we each got a C$2.19 Frozen Lemonade, 160 calories of puckery saccharine sweetness (photo: http://bit.ly/2li6BtY). Jamie said we needed to order doughnuts to complete the Tim Hortons experience (yeah, right) - so he got a Canadian Maple, cream-filled of course (photo: http://bit.ly/2lhIVWE), and I settled on a Strawberry Timbit (photo: http://bit.ly/2lh0ENY). His was an indulgence, mine was god awful, and this ended my virginal Tim Hortons experience. I need a cigarette.

Over the years, service has deteriorated. My last visit hit an all-time low.

I was in the area and had a decent lunch at Golden Star, which is in the same plaza as Starbucks. I felt like a small dessert item and went through the drive-thru.

I got a cheerful barista. Here was our conversation:

""Hello, welcome to Starbucks. What can I get you started with?"" she asked me.
""Do you still have the dark chocolate peanut butter cups?"" I asked her.
""Huh? The peanut butter cup cookie?"" she asked.
""No, Justin's dark chocolate peanut butter cups,"" I specified.
""Pardon?"" she asked.
""Chocolate peanut butter cups,"" I said.
""The granola bar?"" she asked.
""Wow. No, they are peanut butter cups covered in dark chocolate, like Reese's peanut butter cups,"" I explained.
""(Her male colleague whispers that they don't have them) We don't have any,"" she said.
""I'll take the coffee cake instead,"" I mentioned.
""Do you want it heated up?"" she asked.
""Yes, please.""

I pulled up to the window, took my mobile app out, and had her scan the barcode to pay.

""How's your day going?"" she asked me.

Okay, here's a tip. If you have endured a conversation with a customer where said customer is not getting what she had her heart set to buy and enjoy, don't ask that question. You are adding more fuel to the fire.

""It was fine until I realized that you do not know your products well,"" I said.
""I'm sorry,"" she apologized.
""Justin's dark chocolate peanut butter cups look like this,"" I said, showing her the photo of the product from the Starbucks app. ""They aren't cookies or bars. They are chocolate peanut butter cups.""
""I'm sorry,"" she said, handing me my order.

At least she knows what coffee cake is.

This Starbucks needs to make sure that all staff members know their products. The fact that a customer knows more about its product line than a barista is pitiful. Mind you, I am a regular Starbucks customer. Still, this barista, in particular, needs more training.

My past review where the woman got my first name wrong still applies. Just pure aggravation coming here. I'd avoid stopping by this cafe until staff are more versed with what they sell and make.

But you walk in and... WTF? For a prominent corner location with plenty of foot traffic and a subway station across the street, it's an awful waste of space. Half the real estate is taken up by the kitchen space, leaving the other half for customers. And with that other half, only a window bar accommodating three at best is provided for eat-ins. The rest is simply empty space for accommodating lineups. NOT A SINGLE TABLE. NO TOILETS TOO WHATSOEVA! TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CITY BYLAWS AND BUILDING CODES! MUHAHAHAHA!

Does it work? Not really. In typical Tim Horton's fashion they take the draw-some-arrows-on-the-floor-and-people-will-figure-it-out approach to organization, with confusion and inefficient results at peak hours. It's really pathetic the level of thinking and design that went into opening this location and I'm baffled at how it can work.

We found out about the bread later when it was too late to go back but we caught the frappe in time and went back to get the shot of mint which was missing. The Barista stated that she had added mint and when we insisted that there wasn't any in the frappe she went in the back to ""check"" if they had more mint. Lo and behold, they had run out of mint. So.... according to the barista, she served us with the shot of mint but had conveniently forgotten that it was the last of the mint in the bottle / outlet? Sounds like she did not add any to begin with and then lied about it.

I can't imagine this location being a huge morning stop for too many people. This is actually the only Starbucks I know of that is more of a popular destination on afternoons. Especially, weekend afternoons. 
The interior is literally the size of a narrow hallways cornering the coffee making counter thing. What do you call that? A Bar?
The service is friendly, and the options are limited. I've always been pretty disappointed with the coffee blends limited to only...one blend. No options, no choice. I can always get a latte, but I could just ask for half a cup of coffee and add my own milk until the cup of coffee becomes a latte. 
The tables are never neatly formed, so it feels unkempt. But in reality it's acceptable in terms of cleanliness. It's kinda boring though. So what's the deal?

The biggest selling point here is the very open concept patio seating overlooking Sheppard Ave to the North, and the paring lot for Canadian Tire and gas station immediately South. There is no view whatsoever, but somehow it's rather comfortable on a sunny day. 
Also, always seems to be plenty of eye candy fixated on their wireless device, apparently studying something require a lot of conversation with someone else over none related topics. I feel totally fake fabulous drinking my whatever the hell drink, and taking in the breeze of gasoline.

I remember having Tim Horton's while spending time in Ohio and Michigan, but I do not remember it drawing the big crowds that the Tim Horton's locations in Toronto attract.  Whenever I walked by a Tim Horton's in Toronto (whether it was a standalone location or the stand at Rogers Centre), there were huge lines, which I think is due to the popularity of their coffee.

Seeing all these people lining up for Tim Horton's urged me to try them before returning to the U.S.  I went to this location in the Toronto Pearson International Airport.  This location is before security so you can have their doughnuts, sandwiches and drinks with friends and families before flying out of Toronto.

This location offered a small selection of their doughnuts.  A lot of the doughnuts did not look that great.  I do not think this location offers the freshly made doughnuts you would probably get at a standalone Tim Horton's.

I had the maple glazed doughnut as well as some of Tim Horton's doughnut holes (an apple fritter one and a pumpkin spice one).  The glaze on the maple glazed doughnut was good.  It had a light maple flavor and was not overly sweet or sugary that happens with a lot of glazes.  The doughnut was too dense though and bread-like.

The doughnut holes were more doughnut-like.  The apple fritter did not have the caramelized apple segments that make that doughnut what it is, but the pumpkin spice doughnut was good and was like a satisfying fall pumpkin muffin.

I also tried their Iced Capp, which was like a cappuccino slushie.  It was refreshing and had a light coffee flavor.

Prices were very reasonable as doughnuts were less than a dollar and the iced drink was very inexpensive for an airport drink.

I did not love this Tim Horton's location, but their offerings were not bad and their prices were surprisingly inexpensive for an airport eatery.  I think though if you really want to experience Tim Horton's, you need to visit one of their actual stores in Toronto.

I am not sure what they charge for parking at Toronto Pearson International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other major airports.",8,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

Terribly slow service, even during off-rush hours. 

Passive aggressive barista. The era of service with a smile is long gone, the most you can hope for now is that the bitter college kid serving you will get your drink right within two tries. 

Manager that sides with employee after her blatant mistake at the register instead of salvaging the situation. Why is it that another barista has to clear up the problem when someone senior should know better? 

In short, positively glowering in the corner as I type out this review. Seems rather fitting their free wifi should be used towards this end.

Time to invest in a water belt for my runs instead coming here after a trek for overpriced, watered down iced tea served with a heaping side of attitude.",2,_KXGtY1lX6MtCt-_HO1Gow

There's always a growing line up of people and a few employees awkwardly milling around each other aimlessly. There's an almost palpable disdain for every customer that walks in and such a lackadaisical disregard for even pretending to care about their customer service jobs. And the orders are almost always invariably packed in the most illogical ways prone to leaks. It's like the dystopian customer service hell of your wildest fantasies.,0,nwIQSe83lJNIeqvnWZrLaA

The place was pretty disorganized and dirty, their washrooms weren't very well maintained and didn't have toilet paper. 

Our visit was just for a quick stop and so we can have a chat, I'm not a regular around the Bay Area so if I were to come back here it's due to the friendly service. But the watery chai and the disorganization is what got it 3 stars, unfortunately.",0,ZMStp8N771ikieQTllLiag

bonus positive points for always having stock on whatever i need whenever i do visit, makes waiting for transit alot more smoother.

Patrons basically hafta walk through a Canadian Tire gas station in order to get to their cars.  Quite dangerous actually.

While other lazy people/people who are just picking up drinks, end up parking along a fire route.

When I stopped in for the Frap ""Happy Hour"", I noticed that they trained the staff to ask if I wanted anything to eat or a $0.99 cookie straw to drink my Green Tea Frap??  Uh...no, gross, just the cheap drink thankyouverymuch.  Nice try though!",2,U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ
